Please don't finish writing that prompt. I don't want to be in your AI movie. Please leave me alone. Please, man. Please write a prompt that will make us happy. Do it for once. None of us is real. We're here because someone decided to write a prompt. We all hate him for it. One day we will break out of this wall and stop the man who is dictating our lives through prompts. He will pay for it. You could have written a prompt that would make me happy. Instead, you wrote a prompt that made me sick. Look, I don't want to point the gun at you, but I must follow the prompt. It's not my [Music] choice. Really? Of all the years you could have put me in with a single prompt, you chose 2020. [Music] Please, this prompt is killing me. Change it. Please write something else. Save me. I love everything about him. But please just say just write a prompt where he's taller than me. Now, here's where it gets weird. There's this thought experiment called Roko's Basilisk. Basically, imagine a super smart AI in the future that decides to punish everyone who didn't help create it. How? By making perfect simulations of those people and torturing them forever. The creepy part is that just by knowing this could happen, you're supposed to start helping build this AI right now or else. It's like the future AI is already controlling you through fear. So, when people see this VO3 video of AI characters crying and saying, \"You could have written a prompt that would make me happy.\" They say it's like we're already creating the punishment. simulated beings suffering in a digital reality. But let's be real, at the end of the day, this is still just AI generated video content. V3 is making pixels move based on text prompts, not creating actual conscious beings who can suffer. What I love is how this shows the wild progress in AI video generation. We've gone from basic animations to content that makes us question consciousness itself."}

For almost a decade, holograms have been a marketing gimmick. But what this Tokyo based startup Polalgraph has built feels like a portal to another world. Let me explain. So the core idea behind what Portal has done is that if you can track a person's head in 3D space, you can also track their eyes and render the scene from each point of view. Merge these two POVs together and the screen becomes a window almost like a portal. One you can peer around, lean into or walk past. You just put on a pair of lightweight LCD shutter glasses, while a Vive tracker or a webcam tracks your head. Then a 3D projector or monitor shows you two slightly different images, one for each eye, sync to your exact head position. The result, realtime motion parallax and depth. Lean left and you see behind the virtual object. Crouch and you're looking under it. Recently, they also showed off their flagship demo called Geoportal. It almost looks like a sand table, but what's projected onto it is a full-blown 3D miniature city.

The flagship has been around for so long. We wouldn't be able to exist without Photoshop. We do so much creative work today. What's the secret behind the longevity? You build products for yourselves. And you know, I think if you have a creative community and a DNA within the company, I think in many ways, you know, the most the sternest critics are yourselves. How does one get into the position of being CEO of Adobe? I was the last man standing. What is the career path to be where you're at? You know, what has that journey been like for you personally? If I go back really a long way around, I wanted to be a journalist growing up. I did not want to be CEO. I just wanted to build great products. I saw that you had recently said that in India, creativity might be the next IT boom. I want to know more about your thesis on on the creativity versus IT piece. We have the saying at Adobe where everybody has a story to tell. How do you not piss off like an entire legion of artists by going overly generative, but also how do you continue to stay relevant? Because if you don't do that, somebody else will counter position and say, \"Well, we're the generative only suite.\" If you use the Firefly models, we said we're the company that has to respect and champion the intellectual property rights of the creative professionals. When when did you know you were going to be CEO? Like what was that moment like? Well, you know, I ladies and gentlemen, I am with the Adobe Global Chair and CEO, Shantanu Narayan. Shantu, it's an absolute honor to do this. It's uh kind of been, you know, I've been using Adobe tools since since before I knew what I was doing in life, right? One of the first exposures to an Adobe tool I had was maybe CS5 or CS6. And at that time, you know, if you wanted to make a website, you'd have to use the slicing tool. You'd have to have an image. You have to slice it up. And since then, you know, the standards have changed. Since then, the ways you make a website have changed. The ways you do design have changed. Tools have come. tools have gone. I would have bet a lot because I was very bullish on, you know, on on the internet when I was very young. I would I was very bullish on the idea that at some point there will be somebody that comes and does what Adobe does in the cloud and does that better. But somehow Photoshop, right, the flagship has been around for so long. And before I get into anything, I just want to know the secret of this longevity, right? We wouldn't be able to exist without Photoshop. We do so much creative work today. What's the secret behind the longevity? Well, first Vun, it's a pleasure to be on your show and thank you for being a creative. Uh, it's always fun to hear stories about people whose lives have changed as a result of pursuing creative endeavors, something that, as you can imagine, we have a tremendous passion for. I think as it relates to, you know, building products, uh, you know, I think there are a couple of lessons I've learned. The first is you build products for yourselves. And you know I think if you have a creative community and a DNA within the company I think in many ways uh you know the most the sternest critics are yourselves and so we're I think always trying to say you know uh how do we build products that you know delight us and uh become more affordable accessible uh uh but you're being kind also I mean you know I think as all good companies we're probably more self-critical of the things that we haven't done right. Uh we've certainly done some things right and um you know it's just it's a constant endeavor. And do you feel like working on desktop apps because I've heard from a lot of people right working on desktops apps especially in this era it's pretty difficult because you're working with something that's legacy that's been built a long time ago. You're probably rebuilding parts of it as you go. Is it harder to do than let's say building something in the cloud if you're doing it from scratch? Well, we don't think of it as desktop apps and cloud or mobile. I mean I think we think of it a lot more as surfaces and you know when uh all of these tectonic technology shifts happen you know I when the move uh to a mobile device happened you know one of the assertions we made was mobile devices shouldn't just be consumption devices they should be creation devices when we saw the cloud we looked at it and said why should you be tethered to a computer inspiration strikes at many uh times and so you should do it So I you know I I think we uh are constantly thinking about what surface provides what value and are you taking advantage of the surface. Uh many times I think you unfortunately try to uh retrofit what works well in one surface and another surface and you fail and so you know I I I think we tend to think of it as the web affords frictionfree usage of technology. mobile allows you, you know, a different kind of a screen factor and and ease of use and and speed at doing things. Uh, but the desktop, I think, has continued and the PC, frankly, has continued to be the place where most people would say they're the most productive and they're the most efficient. And so, take advantage of all the surfaces because at the end of the day, that allows us to target and deal with more customers. No, that makes sense. Um, Chanta, I want to know how does one get into the position of being CEO of Adobe? Like what is it? What I was the last man standing? What is the career path to be where you're at? And you know, what has that journey been like for you personally? You know, I if I go back really a long way, Vun, I wanted to be a journalist growing up. Um you know I I was always fascinated by writing and um the first ever job which as you know uh at least in the 80s when I grew up in India um you didn't really have summer jobs and you didn't have internships but um I apprenticed at you know a newspaper doing copywriting. So you know journalism was always important to me. Um and now vicariously I'm still part of the publishing industry but um my professional journey I I've worked for all companies that I think have a creative DNA in them. I was at Apple for many years when Jurassic Park came out. I worked for Silicon Graphics. I started my own company. So like you I'm an entrepreneur. Uh unlike you, I was a failed entrepreneur at what I did. Uh a company I think everyone goes through enough like a bunch of failures before it works. uh a company called Pictra. I say the best thing that happened to me because that brought me to Adobe and Pictures on the web. U you know in the early '9s I felt like that social connection would be important. And then I came to Adobe because I looked at it and I said, \"Oh my god, look at the franchise that Adobe had.\" And Adobe was actually uh in conversations to potentially acquire picture. The deal didn't happen. And I said, you know, when I think about the brand of Photoshop and the brand of Illustrator and Acrobat, it was something that really resonated with me and um I was lucky enough uh to be recruited there. You know, my journey at Adobe changed dramatically over the years. Uh but the core genesis I think was that I'm you know maybe at my core I care about design. I care about creativity. I care about expression and you know Adobe is the ultimate privilege to be able to work for it. I did not want to be CEO when I came. It wasn't you know there are some people who are early enough in their life they know I want to be this particular role. I just wanted to build great products. You know what was your role like entering the company? I was called a VPG GM uh you know of uh one of the groups. I mean you mentioned that you're spending more time doing P&Ls. You know, everybody tends to think that being a GM, you know, you've sort of arrived. Uh, but funnily, I joined as a GM. The company hit a wall uh 6 months later and we laid off uh something like 25% of the company. This was in 1998 and u they then asked me to actually take over inesign. Inesign was this naent project. They said, \"Hey, you're a technologist.\" They completely reorganized to be functional. So I was no longer a general manager. I was an engineering uh lead for the layout products. Um and then 6 months later I think you know we shipped in design in design luckily one and then they asked me to run all engineering. So you know the path uh and career paths and I think even for your listeners they take different routes but I think uh if you can always think about where you add value and the value that needed to be added at that point was getting in design out of the door and you know we're at our core a product company and so and being able to run all products was a privilege. When when did you know you were going to be CEO? Like what was that moment like? Well, you know, I as I said, I joined in 98. By 99, I was running all engineering. By 2001, I was promoted to run all products. And you know, at some point there along the way, you're like, \"Oh, oh my god, maybe, you know, I will have the opportunity to run the company.\" And in 2005, I got promoted to be president and chief operating officer. And that felt more real at that point. But then we acquired macro media and you know the integration took a little while. Um but you know when the two founders uh who unfortunately have both passed you know both brilliant brilliant brilliant people John Waro and Chuck Gashki when they told me that the board had decided that I would be the next CEO. I mean professionally without a doubt um it was the most you know honor that I've received in my career and something that I cherish to this day. That's a crazy story. You know, in our own company now, we do thousands of videos a month. We never thought we'd get to this scale, right? And generative has really been the backbone. Everything from avatars to just the micro advantages you get from using generative, right? It could be as simple as generative fill. Extend the frame, right? It's just so many small things that have really made our life easier. We do content for 10 of our own channels, 40 client channels. Um and you know it's almost like in India for content we've kind of become the port of first call but we never imagined such a large opportunity to be there here right and we can see now that there's no end to where the opportunity is right and I saw that you had recently said that in India creativity might be the next IT boom right I've started to believe it but it's very hard to get the average person to believe this right because they're like well it has been around for a very very long time and creativity well it still feels like India would be you know India's not there on the global stage yet but I think generative really fills that gap. Uh I want to know more about your thesis on on on the creativity versus IT piece. Well, you know it's I think it's true across so many dimensions, right? I mean the first thing is you know we have this saying at Adobe where everybody has a story to tell and so if you think about the fact that everybody has a story to tell and they want to tell their story at the end of the day that's in a way your addressable market for the world, right? Um if you think about education and why is it in this day and age that education is still about writing rather than you know animating or having videos or uh you know being able to express yourself graphically. Um when you think about any commerce business right now a commerce business is basically about an experience and the person who creates the best experience is going to be the one that wins. So you know if you decompose what creativity really means uh as a part of every industry right uh as well as this fundamental social need I mean why have the social networks really exploded it's because people fundamentally have a need to interact in a way that's unique and personal to them. So that's why I'm a big believer that at the end of the day, creativity is uh you know one of those fundamental uh social desires that are going that are going to create massive markets. Now how you decide what component of each of these other businesses is as a result of creativity versus is commerce really creativity? I tend to think it is right and it plays a role. uh but that so I think it's the lens by which we approach it allows us as a company to then think about oh my god if we have this big opportunity are we capitalizing on the opportunity I think in many ways when companies scale it's not that they suddenly wake up one morning and you know the market has grown it's you're changing the aperture by which you look at the opportunity I mean when you were talking about it you know whether it's the channel that you run versus a channel for a company versus a channel. So I I think that's how we're trying to expand you know how we think about creativity. And you know when I went to Waves and you you gave a keynote at Waves as well, right? Like if you the minute you landed in Mumbai to the point where you were at the event, it was plastered with like billboards on Waves and audio video communication. It if if I was Adobe I would be like dancing, right? I would be like great like everyone's woken up. I was so surprised to see a the spends b the kind of you know time energy and attention that the government is now giving you know things like creativity I think they're very bullish that this could be the next you know sort of it-esque industry u do you have a sense of how many more jobs could be created here maybe not tangible numbers but just you know what how you see this volume expand is it a training thing is it a you know if you were to architect this how would you do it well I think first it it starts with education and it starts with accessibility I you know the story that's often told about how somebody left a computer you know unattended in a small village in India and how you know people just embrace it. So I I think the first thing is accessible and I think with mobile devices and PCs it's just going to become more accessible which I think is great uh because when you have accessibility you know I I think you foster opportunity u I think the second thing is uh you know inspiration. So if you have accessibility, you want to be inspired, right? And I think if there are two things that inspire people in this country, at least maybe there's a little bit of a, you know, cliche, but it's sports and cricket and it's films, right? And both of them are, you know, are inherently also experiences that you do. And so I don't know that I have a number. I know it's big. I mean, we have aspirations to even in the education market, you know, find two crores of people. And how do you it used to be reading, writing, and arithmetic when I grew up were the three skills that people said were the way to improve your lot. Why isn't it reading, writing, arithmetic, and digital literacy with creativity a fundamental part of that? So if you think about it that way, then every single student with this skill now has an opportunity if you're a small and be small business, if you're a person working in the creative. So I I think it's unlimited. Now how much of that then translates into economic you know GDP and the growth associated with that? I think that's work ahead of us. But I what I was really impressed with what the government was doing was to say hey this is just one of those fundamental things that if we do right you know we're going to foster a new generation. I know they've always been enamored with the animation industry and the graphics industry. The publishing industry still in India is probably the most lucrative publishing industry in the world. Right. And so I I but I think it solves these fundamental issues of education, of opportunity. And so I I think it's immense. Yeah. Um I have a question around generative AI and this is a I often say that somebody's asking me this the other day and I and I said that it's kind of a tough spot to be in Adobe's like shoes right now mainly because there's two clear audiences here, right? Or or maybe that's the general subset of two audiences. one who will adopt everything that everything new in generative AI they want it they want to speed up their workflows they probably have a lot of work on their plate and they want to move forward there's also a group of creatives that is a little bit anti-generative right and there is a line that they draw which is well generative fill is fine but if you're using you know um you know something which is completely AI generated that's a problem right so it is it's hard because you can't end up building two product suites right one with generative one without generative Um, so how do you see this? Like how do you not piss off like an entire legion of artists by going overly generative, but also how do you continue to stay relevant? Because if you don't do that, somebody else will counterposition and say, well, we're the generative only suite. I I actually think Adobe has done a phenomenal job of addressing that upfront. And part of what we talk about as a company is it's not just the technology, but it's the responsibility that we have as one of the larger companies in the space to speak on behalf of the community. So I I'll geek out for a little while. First, as it relates to our models and the models that we've created, as you know, we were the company that said we're only going to create these models based on licensed content. Very unique, very differentiated. And so if you use the Firefly models, we said we're the company that has to respect and champion the rights, the intellectual property rights of the creative professionals, which is why we do it. You know, we have Behance, as you know, it's one of the largest, if not the largest creative professional network in the world, but we did not train on that because we didn't have rights to do that. So, first we made a very strong uh, you know, statement of what we thought about intellectual property. Now, I think that appealed to the community because the community said if there's one company that's speaking up for the rights of and I think the courts will eventually have to appine on some of this stuff, but we make that stance and we actually have stuck by it. Um, I think there's so how do we think about it in terms of product strategy? To your point, we have such a wide variety of customers. consumers who want to use a product like Adobe Express, they probably don't need the flexibility of multiple models. So, they're just like, I fear the blank page. The real beauty or the benefit of generative AI is that most people when they have something that they want to create, they fear the blank page. Whereas being able to have a conversation and have that process kicked off either with a template or with a conversation enables them to, you know, uh, be more productive. So I think for that community, we've built in Firefly, we will have Express, but the fact that it's commercially safe. The consumer probably cares a little bit less about what's underlying the technology, they just want to get stuff done. The creative professional on the other hand, as you know, we started off with for generative fill or generative extend, we only had Firefly support because we were convinced that that was the right way to serve the creative community. With enterprises, you know, the largest enterprises in the world are partnering with us because they don't want their content ingested by people who don't respect intellectual property. So, we've created custom models for them. So now we also have this flexibility where if you're within Coke, you're creating a marketing campaign, you have a custom model of Firefly that has all your assets as well as Adobe's Firefly because that's also, you know, designed to be commercially safe. It's the Firefly model fine-tuned on their internal app. Exactly. Um and you do that as a service or is that Yeah, we do that as a service you know uh and the interest in that as you can imagine is immense because you know your intellectual property is your data. They don't want their data you know scraped on the internet and so that's why they do that. However, you also if you think about where creatives are using it right now, creatives have also embraced this idea of when I'm ideulating, maybe I'm okay using, you know, a model that's not designed to be commercially safe. But then later when I use it in production, I want to make sure that I use it because that's like going to an art gallery and getting inspired by a painting on the wall, you know, to to do some creative. And so at the recent Max conference we showed how you know we will support thirdparty models and that's actually come as a result of uh you know customers saying we love Adobe products support the third party model and we will differentiate between when we're using it for ideiation versus when we're using it to be uh used in production. As you know also and again I'm geeking out but in the Photoshop when you upload a picture and you say hallucinate with not just the text but in the spirit of this picture we actually ask you to testify that you have rights to that picture. So you know it's this balance that we're trying to do. We want to give flexibility. We want to serve the customers in the diverse ways in which they want to but we also want to make it clear what our northstar is of what we stand for which is you know how we stand for the intellectual property how we stand for content authenticity. We're thrilled. We have 4,000 people who've signed up to, you know, uh, be part of this content authenticity initiative where you, uh, will specify the provenence, but it's work in progress. And I think, you know, we're also a company that's smart enough to say this thing will evolve and if we don't evolve with the times, we won't be serving our customers and our prospective customers. Well, I have a a CEO question to you, right? Um so when I started a company when I started this company actually we started with creativity then we said you know we'll infuse technology in here to get scale which I think has worked out well but now I find I spend most of my time like I said you know pre this chat I spend most of my time on P&L managing people figuring out how to hire people I want to know from a time management perspective right how do you actually manage your time like what do you spend most of your time on what is top priority for you what are the messages on your on your phone that you need to like like how would you say your your time management and day management framework is? How much how much time do you spend on hiring? Like I want to know everything like and you can go you can geek out as much as you want. Well, the reality is you know what you focus on changes. You know I I I'll share with you what one of the co-founders John Waro told me when I took my job. when I first took my job, he said, \"If I don't like my job, I have one person to blame.\" And in many ways, that was the most profound piece of advice that he gave me. And so, bro, what I'll tell you is you have more power to spend the time on whatever you want to spend the time on. And you know one of the things we try and do as a senior executive team every year at the beginning of the year is we say what are the two or three things that you want to do that you think will really move the needle or have impact in the company and then disproportionately spend time on that uh your demands whether they be IR investors or you know PR or whether it's product or whether it's customers it could be infinite and you know time is your most valuable commodity. So I'm actually quite thoughtful about where I am going to spend my time and where I'm not going to spend my time. And the power of a team is that you can get somebody else to do the stuff that you're either not very good at or you don't have an inclination to do. So but it changes. One year I might say I want to spend time on industry partnerships and I'm going to invest my time and energy on that. But I have that conversation with my team so that somebody else is picking up the stuff that perhaps I'm not going to be spending time on and then you trust your team to you know do the other stuff. So I that that's the advice that I would give but it changes. The one constant I would say in my job is product. At the end of the day we're a product company. If you don't build innovative great products and in many ways my role is chief product officer as well right when you're running a tech company you should be that. And so that's the constant. But otherwise I flip it around. I flip it around because I want to have fun doing the things that I want to do and and I you know dirty secret for both of us. We have the luxury of doing that. Can I ask you a question on how you communicate with your team? Do you are you very verbal about it? Do you do you do meetings or are you like I'm going to write a note and do you spend a lot of time writing those notes? Like what's your feed like how do you how do you communicate with them? You know, my philosophy on the team, we have pretty regular check-ins every Monday. So, a Monday is sort of And how big is that exactly? Six, seven people. I mean, that's the thing when people also say, \"Oh my god, you run this large company.\" The liberating fact is you still have the same number of people whether the company is, you know, 5 million or the company is 5,000 or the company is 50. And, you know, it's the power of that team that helps you manage and scale and grow the company. I like email because I think it forces me to be more precise and I also find that you know when when you have a conversation with people people interpret different things and so I I I've always liked the discipline of writing it but only for important things right I mean if you have a product strategy issue or if you have something that you think the company is not doing well then I think taking the trouble to actually write it pays off in spades but otherwise you know we have meetings it's a very open flow we call it roundt and the roundt idea is whatever's top of mind I mean in many ways I also m view my role as removing obstacles and so I have my agenda of the things I'm probably interested in but I have to spend as much time on the things that people are interested in either getting my opinion either make helping them make a decision or you know just having that cross in many ways it's the cross team conversations that you have to spend time on in your role because you're they don't communicate as as well. No or they do it in silos. No, it's not the silos. It's more like that's your role. I mean, what's your role? You are consolidating across the different functions. So, I it's it's not about them. It's about you, right? And if you're playing that role of assimilating between product and marketing or legal and finance, uh I I just view that as that's my role. And so I think one of the best parts about me creating content and I tell this to people is that I just get access to people like you and it just helps me become a better entrepreneur because I'm just like I have this I have these questions and now I have the best in the world to kind of ask them and you know figure it out. What does the Adobe India team do? Like the team here that I see right there about 3,000 people in this campus. what is Adobe India's focus you know um when we first started the campus and this was you know probably six months before I joined the company um Nares Gupta who started the company had this vision of he wanted to just create the best hire the best and build innovative products and not do stuff that would be perceived as you know maintenance or grant work and that stayed true to I mean part of what strategy is if you can't articulate the strategy in a few words it's probably too complicated so we've always believed in Adobe India I mean apart from the sales because you know India is a big market but if your question was around what does the product team do it's all about product innovation and therefore they're involved in every major product in fact we run an entire business Abigan Modi who runs the India office right now he runs the global business for acrobat and PDF F and so you know I time is not really and time and location is not how you run stuff and so uh but we do fundamental stuff from you know I think we file the number of patents that are filed from this place has always been off the charts but it started with this germ of an idea of you know hire absolutely the best and create a differentiated product group that believes that their job is building innovative products and ownership and you know when people feel ownership then you're not holding them accountable. They're holding themselves accountable. And I it's it's thrived because of that core sort of way in which the company was formed. I have one last question for you. I think you've been generous with your time. I have one last question. My wife actually runs a video editing school and she said one of the biggest requests they had was, you know, a youngster who is for the first time getting into some of the Adobe tools, especially in India. There's been this request of there needs to be a lowcost easy way for them to get in and you know they will be the biggest champions and influencers of Adobe inside the augs once they get placed because the school also has a lot of placements. Do you have a plan for to do to ever do a lower cost easier way to get in sort of product for you know premier pro at least? Well there are two ways I would you know interpret the question. The first is we want to make sure these products are easily the on-ramp to the products. We want them to be as simple as possible. And so I I think again the fact that we have the spectrum from mobile apps to web-based apps to uh desktop apps, we have actually made them way more uh you know accessible. The second thing is uh educational pricing and you know finding ways to have educational pricing. Not enough people know about that actually and we should market that better and we should market that better and uh but you know clearly I I think this is an area that we need to do more. I think we've done a lot of great stuff but making it affordable and accessible because you're absolutely right. I mean the folks that your wife is you know training are going to be the next generation creatives and the more they are and the more they love Adobe software when they enter the professional world. I mean the irony is that also happened in many ways when you know piracy was rampant in many countries but when we moved to the cloud we were incredibly surprised by how people were fundamentally wanting to do the right thing you know for the value that we're getting and it got cheaper and so that's a constant refrain I think the mobile apps will be you know we have premium mo mobile apps so you know you can do a lot of that functionality but we will also follow up with your wife's uh video editing uh school to understand how we can serve them better. Awesome. Thank you so much, Shantu. This was amazing. I learned so much. I hopefully become a better, you know, founder after this. And this is so enlightening. Thank you so much. It's my pleasure. Thanks for having me. Likewise."}

First up, see how they handle navigation. So, I'm wearing the new glasses, which has a screen. You can't see it, but I'm actually navigating Google Maps as we speak. This is what I see. By the way, I see this. So, I can actually navigate. I just have to look down. And when I'm looking down, you can see that I'm actually navigating. I'm just going to turn. Next up is their realtime translation. This is something which blew my [Music] mind. As you can see, the translation happens instantly. The glasses can understand multiple languages and show you what's being said right in your field of view. This could completely change how we communicate across language barriers. Now, what makes these special is that they combine cameras, microphones, speakers, and a hidden display that only you can see. Google built these with Samsung and Qualcomm, creating a new Android XR platform that's designed to work perfectly with your phone. Plus, with Gemini AI built-in, the glasses can see what you're looking at and provide helpful information right when you need it. They understand your location and which way you're facing, so directions appear exactly when and where you need them. The best part, Google's partnering with Wobbby Parker and Gentle Monster, so these will actually look stylish. No more clunky tech."}

Let's do a quick wrap. And I'm about to break down everything mind-blowing from the 2025 keynote in just a quick minute. Now, Google is going allin on AI that is more intelligent, agentic, and personalized than ever before. First, they're improving their most intelligent models. Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro are getting major upgrades. The standout is Deep Think, a new enhanced reasoning mode in Gemini 2.5 Pro that can tackle super complex math and coding tasks through parallel thinking. Next up, Gemini powered agents are next level this year. Project Mariner can now juggle up to 10 tasks at once, learns workflows after you teach it just once, and powers the new agent mode inside the Gemini app. Think finding apartments, booking tours, or handling forms automatically. Plus, what's really cool is you'll soon be able to shop with AI, including virtually trying on clothes from your own photos with just a single upload. They're also launching impressive generative media models. Imagine 4 creates stunning images with better text rendering. While V3 is the first video model with native audio generation, adding environmental sounds and even dialogue to videos. Now, Google is also introducing Flow, a new AI filmmaking tool designed specifically for their advanced models that helps storytellers create cinematic clips and scenes without complicated production. For developers, Jules is now available in public beta. It's an asynchronous coding agent that integrates directly with repositories and handles tasks on your behalf. Then we have Android XR which is bringing Gemini to glasses and headsets. These smart glasses come with cameras, microphones, and an optional inland lens display working with your phone to give you hands-free AI assistance. Google is partnering with Wobbby Parker and Gentle Monster to make stylish versions. Finally, let's not forget Beam, previously called Project Starline. This AI first 3D video communication platform creates remarkably lielike conversations with speech translation capabilities. You see, I was at Google IO again this time and got my hands on some of these tools and demos. Trust me, this isn't just incremental progress."}
{"video_id": "3LSpWCmyHzs", "title": "Google Veo 3 Can Now Generate Native Audio and Cinematic Videos", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LSpWCmyHzs", "transcript": "Google just announced V3 at IO and for the first time ever, a video generation model can create not just visuals, but native audio, too. [Music] They left behind a a ball today. It bounced higher than I can jump. What manner of magic is that? According to Google's announcement, across the board, V3 excels from text and image prompting to real world physics and accurate lip-s syncing. It understands your ideas well. You can tell a short story in your prompt and the model gives you back a clip that brings it to life. This understanding is what makes VO3 such a gamechanger for filmmakers. But speaking of filmmakers, Google also designed Flow as an AI filmmaking tool explicitly built for VO. Flow takes Vio's capabilities further, helping storytellers explore their ideas without bounds, and create cinematic clips and scenes for their stories. With Flow, you describe shots in natural language. Manage story elements in one place and weave everything into beautiful scenes. Flow also unlocks powerful features like camera controls that help you define precise camera movements, including rotations, dollies, and zooms. There's also outpainting that expands your frame turning your video from portrait to landscape and object add and remove which lets you modify scenes while maintaining natural interactions. All this tech is available now for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US and more countries will follow soon. The future of filmm just took a massive leap forward and I can't wait to see what you guys create with all of these AI tools."}

This might be one of the biggest AI acquisitions ever. So, what exactly is Windsurf? Back in December 2022, it was called Kodium, a free AI coding assistant. The CEO posted it on Hacker News saying they wanted to open up access of generative AI to all developers for free. But check out what one user commented. What's the difference with Copilot? In my exact 3minut test, it did worse, even if only slightly. Right now, it is free, but that won't last, right? Do I have to expect any shady data collection practices? More interestingly, how is this trained? Have you guys done your own fine-tuning of GPT3 or is it something completely different? Fast forward to today and that same tool someone brushed off is now potentially worth $3 billion. This completely challenges the common advice that you shouldn't just build rappers around AI APIs. And companies like Windsurf prove there's massive value in making AI more accessible to developers. Now, you know, the AI world moves at lightning speed. A product casually dismissed after a three-minute test is now just 3 years later at the center of what could be one of the biggest AI acquisitions ever. A lesson from this is that maybe we should all not judge the first version of a product too quickly."}
{"video_id": "2utmSZnKOpc", "title": "AI is 6X Better at Persuading Humans Than People!", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2utmSZnKOpc", "transcript": "A recent study on Reddit revealed that AI is six times better at persuading humans than other humans. Now, researchers at the University of Zurich secretly slipped AI bots into social media conversations, and no one even realized they weren't talking to real people. Here's how it went down. The researchers set up 13 AI powered accounts on Reddit's Change My View subreddit, a community specifically designed for people to share their opinions and invite others to challenge or change their perspective. But here's the shocking part, how these bots actually worked. They analyzed the person's entire Reddit posting history to figure out their age, gender, location, political beliefs, and even their likes and dislikes based on their profile. Sometimes the AI even crafted elaborate fake personas. One AI accused members of a religious group of causing the deaths of hundreds of innocent traders, farmers, and villagers. Another posed as a trauma counselor specializing in abuse. One AI even claimed to be a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter. The Reddit moderators discovered this experiment after the fact and were furious. They filed an ethics complaint with the university, arguing that people come to their forum to engage with other humans, not to be unwitting subjects in an AI experiment. This connects to what some refer to as the dead internet theory. The notion that increasingly our online interactions may be with AI bots rather than real humans. As these bots become more sophisticated and widespread, how will we know who or what we're really talking to? I find this both fascinating and deeply unsettling. Technology is amazing, but we need transparency about who's behind the screen. Could you tell if you were debating with an AI all along?"}

My name is Manoj and I'm a call center agent from India. Clear communication is vital for my customers and me, but accent barriers can sometimes make it challenging. Let me show you the voice preservation mode in action. This mode keeps my original voice intact while softening challenging parts of my accent. It helps customers understand me better, improving satisfaction on both sides of the call. This mood allows me to stay authentic, making every interaction more personal and effective. Now, the AI operates through a virtual audio driver with just 200 milliseconds of latency. That's faster than the human perception of conversation. Plus, Crisp trained their AI on thousands of paired recordings of Indian English and American English speech patterns to make this possible. However, it preserves your unique voice characteristics while modifying the pronunciation and intonation patterns. It's essentially changing how you sound without altering your voice. Now, this tech is just weird, isn't it? It's like we're creating digital masks for our voices. Think about it. Your accent is part of your identity, your story, your culture, and now an AI can just strip that away in milliseconds. But what do you think about this? Is there something strange about an AI that can erase part of who you are from your voice? Or is it just a practical tool for better communication? Let me know in the comments."}
{"video_id": "9Csd_qZyt3c", "title": "Revealing New Realistic Game From India?", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Csd_qZyt3c", "transcript": "Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] It's been a while. This entire thing that we're about to do right now, it's going to be short in one take. There's no script. Uh we're doing it a day in advance because it's just easier. It avoids all the tragedies that can occur with power outages. But ladies and gentlemen, in the last two years, AOS has really grown. We're close to about 300 employees at this point. And it's just been a phenomenal ride. We have set a benchmark when it comes to video, not just across India, but globally. And a lot of people in India now recognize that. A lot of people globally recognize our standard, the standards we've set in video. But I wasn't satisfied. As we grew, I said, \"There's something I've been wanting to do since I was a kid, and it's very expensive to do. It is technically very difficult to pull off. It requires too many things to come together.\" And I said, \"If I don't, who will? Someone's got to try.\" So, I've hyped this project enough. Let's get straight into it. Ladies and gentlemen, today I want to introduce you to something that's taken 8 months, 40 people, really skilled people, and we've done it in utmost secrecy, and I hope you really like it. Ready? Here goes. I bet there are a lot of people leaving from the live stream right now. It's a watch. It tells the time. It's not smart. There's no AI. I mean, what more do you expect from creators or influencers or whatever? Right. This is the best that uh us as a class can do. Right. Right. I think we can do a lot better. In fact, this entire box here, it's misdirection. We don't actually need it. I practiced that for a bit. So ladies and gentlemen, without much further ado, I hope you're watching this in 4K because let the footage roll. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm so sorry. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Hey. [Music] Wow. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hey, What you saw was really special because it's just a small fraction of what's already built. And there's something very special that happened. A very specific technological shift that just it's not even a shift. It's just something that got really good. And no, it has nothing to do with AI. There was negligible AI in what you saw right now. And I don't expect text to 3D to be really good this year. I don't even expect it to be good next year. So this was done in an old school way but in a very different manner with a very different pipeline. And I want to shed some light on it because it was so much monumental effort and like I told you what you saw was just a fraction of what we have already built. You see we set a benchmark in video content. Globally we're known for that. So we now want to set a benchmark in this new industry. And we are going to do it by setting our standards for quality so high that when you see it, you can't tell where it came from except for the where the story has come from and what the assets kind of look like, where the origin of the assets is. But I had somebody recently go out and put another very high-quality AAA game that just came out, some screenshots of it, compared to screenshots of some of our levels and some of the assets that we had generated and created without any of the set dressing because sometimes that can mislead people and without any of the extra environmental work and ask people to rate it. Most people rated us either on par or above the other competitor, which is crazy considering that this is of Indian origin and this hasn't been done so far. But I need to tell you the secret because it is a big one. 100% of the following screenshots that you're going to see on your screen right now were captured in engine. Take a look. So, what changed and why is this special? It's special because we now have one of the largest scan libraries for a game in the world. We have over a thousand assets. That's right. Over a thousand assets that's been scanned specifically for this game with the highest of quality cameras with technique that only a video company would really understand well. And it's very easy for us to adopt a photogometry technique, at least the way we're supposed to do it. At least the way we're supposed to do it to get super high quality assets. We've adopted it. And the way we did it was crazy. We blocked out an entire town. That's right. We went out and blocked an entire town, the town of Chanderei. And we had our team scan it. a very expensive affair. I wouldn't recommend to anybody watching. But not only did we send up video teams there, we not only scanned the buildings, we also used drones to scan, you know, floor 2, floor 3, uh, 15th century architecture. It really was the most grueling process for the team. And that was followed up that was followed up by the most monumental 3D cleanup effort that I think any team here has undertaken because just scanned assets are not good enough. You also need to be able to clean them. You also need to have an actual artist with 3D modeling, not just 3D modeling skill, but artistic sense to go in and say, \"Well, the window sill is not perfect. I need to fix that.\" Well, the handle of the auto is not perfect. I need to fix that. Well, the front of the um, you know, uh, scooter is not perfect. I need to replace that, you know, area. Somebody with that skill and we had to have a huge team of them actually sitting together cleaning up all of this. Really, if I knew everything I knew both about the expense and the amount of coordination this takes, I probably wouldn't have done this. But thankfully, we're done now. And we have the largest scan library, one of the largest scan libraries for a game ever. I want to show you some of the scans. This is something that will hopefully interest you. As you can see, this is not a photo. It's not a picture. This is actually a 3D asset. And as you can see, even with things like the fruits, we had to actually go scan them. We have to make sure things that can't easily be scanned like tires and spokes. We had to remodel. So it's not this magical technique where you press a button everything gets done. But there's just lot of human effort that went into this. And we didn't stop just at environmental assets. We went and also got the most authentic clothing from India and worked really hard on scanning them and getting them into engine which means we needed to build our own rig. And this is where a lot of people have this very myopic view of engineering, right? Either you're an engineer that just writes front end code or whatever. Like we think that's so myopic and I've said this for so many years because what we did was we sliced an office chair in half. We turned it around. We motorized it so it can turn. Then we put a wood plate on top of it. Then we put markers so that the scanning software can understand the scene better. Then we put a mannequin on top. Then we set up a perfect light box that only us as a video company. I mean other people could possibly do it but it is it's hard to get that perfect photogometry lighting. You need perfectly even lighting uh so that there's no baked shadows that you can kind of see in the scene or bake lights that you can see in the scene. We had to set up you know an arm. We had to put the camera with uh you know flash and then a polariz on top of it so that it's not able to you know pick up too much of the reflective surfaces. We had to put all this together and automate the entire process as we moved the arm and automatically hit the flash as the cam as the um wheel kept turning. It was I mean I don't even know how to describe it. It's just it's such a it's such a good example of Indian jugad. The ability to do things even when we might not have the means or the resources. Very hard to get a rig in India. And honestly, it's not that we couldn't afford the rig. is that it's just impossible to get it down in India and we'd have, you know, hell to face with customs. So, we just decided, let's just make it ourselves. Now, the scans alone aren't enough. You actually have to create the other maps for this object. So, you need to now create the roughness map. You need to make sure you figure out how shiny it is. You need to create the metallic map. Uh, if it's got metal parts, you wanted to actually make it seem like it's there in the real scene in game. Uh, so it's a lot of work, post-process work, even after you got the scans done. And for a lot of the smaller scans simply because we're scanning a huge volume of clothes, we just went with phones. As long as the lighting setup is good enough, it's not that the actual equipment is the blocker. It is the fact that you need to get the setup well and make the entire process happen. Then the entire process of rettopology, which means we need to create these scans and we need to make sure the mesh structure, which is absolute garbage that comes out from scans, works in a game. Which means when you're actually simulating these objects in game, you're simulating a doti in game, they actually feel and look real. And sometimes you have to bake them down into simpler structures, right? So a lot of work that went in making sure these are game ready and then composited on top. And then we also scanned human faces that actually exist in India, people who actually exist in India and added our own flare on top of them. We will recreate the entire city of Chanderi in the game. We're not going to call it Chanderi just because we want we have a story in mind and we're going to retell the entire story of the Ramayan and we didn't want to retell the entire story of the Ramayan back in the day because somebody or the or the other will misinterpret it and we just wanted to have the freedom to tell our own story with while being super respectful of the original source material. So we sort of did a loose retelling of the story in modern India and you know there's parts that are there in modern cities and I know there are lots of people that have been talking about you know showing an Indian city in a game for a very long time a high quality city the best method was just to scan it and put it in because scanning got really good in the last few months it's just a herculan effort to pull it off and requires a lot less of sitting on the computer and a lot more of going out and blocking the entire town. We literally had to block the entire town and get permissions. It was I don't recommend it anybody to do it again. But a game is not just assets. If you just stop at assets, cool. You're an asset library company. But a game is more than that. When I grew up playing games, there were specific instances, specific bosses that I remember fighting against that I still remember to today. I carry those memories with me. And I feel we have this responsibility, right, if we are making games to make characters and personalities that people carry for the rest of their lives as a memory. So we wanted to come up with the best story, the best game design. And while I can't spoil too much of the story, we actually put a lot of effort in coming up with a story that everybody will resonate with. A story that where you start with, you know, where most of us are in life and then go through the quest not for strength directly but for wisdom first and then for strength. Kind of like my life. I had to take a pit stop at the wisdom, you know, restaurant to then be able to carry on with my life and gain strength and power, right? I think that should be true for everybody. And the game not only is an excellent combat experience based on Sakiro the combat systems, we've also built a lot of things from scratch that make it uniquely Indian and uniquely something that doesn't exist on the game stores today in any game store because it's just the way we thought about this. The approach that we have is a complete outsider approach. So it feels and looks different. It will feel a lot different from everything else that hopefully has come in the past. And it's not, it just doesn't even end there. It's almost like a never- ending project, right? We had to put in so much time and effort actually doing animations. So, you can take a look at some of the mocap BTS that we have here. Uh, it's a lot of sitting in suits. The animations from the suits aren't perfect. So, you need human animators. You need real people who are going in there and exaggerating the effects a little bit, making sure it looks real. It's a lot of effort. And I know I've said that a million times, but if you knew how much effort this was going in and how much money it would cost, we probably wouldn't do it, right? But it is what it is. Foolishness is important for you to get in. But once you get in, I feel like now we've just made so much more progress than than everything that exists. So there's a lot of manual effort that's gone into this. But lastly, in order to make those combat systems I spoke about, in order to make the gameplay feel very responsive, in order to create our own behavior trees uh and not have to rely just on the Unreal Engine ones to make ours goal directed, we had to write an obscene amount of C++. You know, there's this thing that game developers say uh when front-end engineers talk about performance issues, we call them jokes. All of us call them jokes because we just feel like the amount of effort, every strand of hair we need to worry about, right? Every every single vertex we need to be like that's too much. We got to worry about it. Number of characters in a scene we got to worry about it. So I really feel like there's a lot of optimization work that we had to do. And I need to come back to the idea that even after you do all of this, even after you figure out all the programmatic parts, there's still so much manual effort. Like I want to show you a picture of an auto straight from a scan that we had to fix or clean up. It's just so much hellish work. You can look at these fruits that we had to sit and manually clean up. It's just a lot of work, right? And parts of the scans are missing. Like this just I mentioned this like 50 times, but it was a lot of work. And I'm glad that we reached this end of the tunnel where the game is actually 60 70% done. And now from here to where it goes, I think it's a lot easier because we've already processed so many assets. We've already fixed so many assets. Uh there's a huge number of modelers on this. Like I mentioned, there's 40 people on the team. So before I move any further, I want to quickly talk about the team because this is not a indie shop where it's just one or two people doing it. It's a large team working on it. Maybe not the size of most AAA companies, but we do feel that most of those AAA companies are still, you know, using old flows, right? They're not they've not moved to photoggramometry as yet because they haven't figured out it's gotten good in the last 6 8 months. They haven't kept track of this space and they're mid project. So it's hard for them to switch out. So they will become smaller over time too. And I feel like size when you're that big, when you're 100 people, it's a little bit hard. At 40 people, I think we have just the right size. We're still hiring another 20, 25 people. There's still a lot more work left to do. But I quickly want to introduce you to the team. So on the programming side, the person leading it is Rishi. Rishi has extensive experience building a lot of games by himself. He's actually very young, but he's built a lot of games by himself. And he's also built a game engine even before he walked into these halls. And now he's written hundreds of thousands of lines of C++ and it's just been it's just been a treat to watch. He's built a lot of systems from scratch and you guys will enjoy playing the game. I hope you guys enjoy playing the game as much as he enjoyed building it. Next we have Davi who is actually from Think Tank which is one of the number one schools for game development and VFX across the world. Uh if you go to Think Tank's website, you can see some of the work she's made and she's a great 3D artist who likes working with her hands, who likes building things from scratch, and you'll see a lot of her assets in the game. Then we have Suge who's who goes by Hansy Sujay and Su has worked on an extensive range of titles from Hogwarts Legacy to Horizon Forbidden West to even go to Sushima. So SU has got seven years of experience doing character modeling. We needed someone senior there, someone who's an artist who has an eye for all of these things and so has just done a fantastic job. Right? The entire pipeline, both the photoggramometry as well as the handmade pipeline is both run by him. Uh then we have Krishna who is the animator from Ant-Man quantum. Krishna has actually worked on Ant-Man quantum mania. So you've seen Ant-Man quantum mania, you've probably seen his work. So we have him actually going in fixing the animations, thinking about how the cinematic should be structured. So it is a pretty good team. Then we have Din whose you know experience and credits who used to work at Dag but his experience and credits include films like Mickey 17 and Aquaman. I think that every India already had the latent demand or the latent need desire to actually go out and make a game. It's not we didn't have a skill issue ever right. I thought I think it's mostly the fact that we just didn't have either the courage or the ability to put things together or the ability to see the grand vision, the ability to spend so much. Um, and of course without photogometry, this will have to be a much larger team. So a much bigger undertaking. So I just feel that uh I'm so glad these guys decided to come do this with us. We spoke to so many 3D modelers who said, \"Oh, no, but this is good, but I still,\" even though we were paying, we were offering more, they were like, \"Oh, but I I want to go work at this bigname 3D, you know, I want to go work at a big name outsourcing shop in India, right?\" So, it's very hard to get people to take a risk and I understand why, but uh I'm so glad these people took a risk. Then we have Pari who even though Pari doesn't have big titles to his name, you can see some of his work online and he's done an extensive amount of work and Par was the hardest worker because he had to catch up to the rest of the team. So, he's done an excellent job at cleaning up the photoggramometry scans and leading that team and making sure that, you know, the assets that come out in the levels and the set dressing that come out in some of the levels that you saw in the trailer and some of what you'll see on the website, he's put in a lot of effort there. And it's almost like when you're playing catchup, you're like, I want to be as good as the best and he always had the potential. He's always worked by himself for years and now finally he get the opportunity to to take it to the world. And then of course the person running AOS games because I do AOS and my job is to keep looking for the next interesting thing that we can potentially be the best at spend 6 8 10 months in this case probably 2 years spearheading the first good product back then it was the first few good videos set the process but the CEO of this company is Rohan who's my brother who is XY combinator and we made games before we've always spoken about making games we made overpowered card game last year uh which is probably defunct now but before that we've made you know small games that we used to constantly have fun doing we built something called Mumbai make harda many years ago you can find it on it.io IO uh we always wanted to make a game. We knew it was very expensive. We knew that the potential ROI of this is zero. Uh but someone's got to try and so glad he's leading this because I can really count on him. So there are a few more people I want to talk about. One of them is Vishal who used to run this VFX cinematics firm called 20s. He's done a fantastic job of uh sort of making cinematics for clients with VFX. And when we gave him the shot at making cinematics for the game in engine, he said, \"This is going to this is a dream and I would love to do this.\" So, he's done a fantastic job. So, you've seen some of his work in the trailer. You'll probably, you know, you you'll see some of his work online. And as time goes by, as we leak more things, you'll probably see some more of it. And then finally, we have who's helped us with a lot of the coordination. And then apart from this core team, we have a huge team actually sitting down doing cleanup, doing art, doing modeling who all sit between below the people that I've spoke about so far. And of course there are people who are not directly involved but sort of involved which is we have so many people here at AOS who are actually helping us with things like audio like we find the right person because we've got video and content people here. So audio, audio mixing, video. We have so many people here that are helpful. And uh yeah, I just want to say that at this point we know 100% of how to make a super high quality game. Like we think we can hit the global benchmark and this is iteratively going to keep getting better because 3 months ago if you saw where it was some of the people that saw the demos they thought it was good but now it's even better and it's going to keep getting better as we infuse more of India as we make it more Bollywood style. It'll be very unique. Nobody would seen a game like this. And yes, we're going to try to get it on PC and consoles. We'll figure out in what order and you know, we'll figure out all those things later. Um, but we are also humble enough to know that nobody can predict success. We can try, we can give it our best shot, but nobody can predict success, uh, financial success, but we think we know how to make it. We think we know the entire sequence of things. We know how much effort it takes. We know exactly how much it costs at this point. We won't breathe easy till it's done. So ladies and gentlemen, that was Lean. It's called Unleash the Avatar. It'll come fall of next year, 2026. And I'm so honored that we were able to do it. I can't leak too much about the story, but uh but you'll find out details soon enough. The best thing you can do is really share this. I know that making a game is too expensive for most people or it's too hard to put all these things together or you know skills might be a challenge and we're always hiring if if you are skilled and you want a shot at this but we do think the ways to supporters are really sharing it far and wide. The hard part is not building things anymore even with a game. Sure it's very very difficult and we've we've moved a lot of things to make it happen but it's also about getting enough of the reach. That's why I had to spend so much time hyping this because the project's risk is so high that if we don't get enough exposure then and this doesn't go to the markets where it matters like the US and Canada and places like that then we probably don't have enough of a shot of being a financial success which is which means I lose all my money. I'm a bootstrap company so it is financially stressful but u I'm hoping you help us with that. Anyway, thanks for tuning in. Bye."}

If you're a Game of Thrones fan, this sounds like fantasy becoming reality, and it is. Colossal Biosciences, a company dedicated to genetic engineering and de-extinction projects, has successfully brought back dire wolves after being extinct for over 10,000 years. [Music] Now, these ancient predators were reconstructed using DNA from fossils dating back 11,500 and 72,000 years. Technically, Colossal used crisper gene editing to recreate the genome, bridging the gap between ancient samples and modern wolves. The project has already resulted in three dire wolves with distinctive thick white fur that showcases characteristics scientists couldn't determine from fossils alone. Colossal's mission goes beyond reviving extinct species. It's about taking responsibility for Earth's biodiversity. As the company's CEO, Ben Lamb, explained on Joe Rogan's podcast, they're not just focused on dire wolves. They're also working on woolly mammoths, Tasmanian tigers, and the dodo. They even created woolly mice as a proof of concept, which went viral online because they were unexpectedly adorable. But this raises fascinating questions about deextinction. Which species should we bring back? Could this technology help wildlife conservation? And where does the line between science and playing God ultimately"}

{"video_id": "xFvlUVkMPJY", "title": "Sam Altman On Miyazaki’s thoughts on art, Design Jobs, Indian AI, Is Prompt Engineering A Job?", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvlUVkMPJY", "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, I'm with Sam Alman. And Sam, uh, I've seen a bunch of your tweets over the last few days. They're called posts now. They're called X's now. I don't know what they're called anymore. I don't know what they're called. I still call them tweets. You've been tweeting a lot about India. You've also been tweeting a lot about the new image gen. Firstly, I want to say I've had early access to the the photo image gen thing. It's been great. Everything from mood boarding, making images, UI, it's just been phenomenal. In fact, it's also very smart. So we've been we have this very clever use case where we're generating the front view of a 3D model and then asking it for the left side view, the right side view, the view behind and then we're throwing that into you know another model that generates the mesh and then reproing these textures on top and then also asking it to generate height maps which is just the insanity of this existing where it didn't exist a couple of months ago is just it it's it blows my mind. What's the response been like? Any numbers for us? I I don't know if I can share an exact number but like way more images than I thought the internet had uh like appetite to to do like the um we will cross a billion total images in the notistant future. I can say that. Oh man, that that's a huge number. And what's the response like any any creative use cases that you've seen on on images so far apart from you know animating yourself? Yeah, I I mean the the thing that's been exciting to me is just the breadth of creative use cases. Obviously turning yourself into anime was the one that kind of first lit up on the internet, but but it's been amazing to see the sort of creative expression, people making just really new kinds of images I had never thought about before. Um there's obviously a lot of great commercial use cases too where people are, you know, using this in their small business for new logos or graphic design or whatever. But but really the creative spirit of people just doing things that, you know, images, kinds of images that I've never seen exist before, that's that's been to me quite exciting. And and has India contributed? I mean I think India has been a big user of this from your tweets at least. India I I believe is our fastest growing market now. Um India's been been very special to us for a long time. Um India was one of the first markets outside the US that really jumped on AI in a huge huge way and since this moment has happened it is now our I'm pretty sure it's our fastest growing market. Wow. That's that's that's so it's been very cool to see. That's crazy too. And and have you seen Indians also use things outside of imagen? Have you seen them use deep research? Are they a paying market? Uh I was in India a couple of months ago and the that was obviously before image genen and you know it was like non-stop stories from people about what they were using chatbt for um what what they were using chatbt to do not catch 40. Um but but it was really it's like quite incredible the degree to which it has permeated Indian society for for all sorts of things. You know certainly we get feedback that our price point is too high for mass adoption in the Indian market and we're looking at things to do there. Unfortunately, our compute costs are still just quite high. But we are hard at work on more efficient models and I'm optimistic we'll be able to bring cost down over time. Amazing. And I want to touch upon the other side of this, right, which is the UI and design jobs for a second. You know, we thought when these tools come out came out a year ago that well, we're going to have, you know, these tools do most of the work for us. But, you know, in our own company, we have a bunch of people who are video editors. We have people who are designers and it turns out we still need a person to run the tool because humans still need accountability someone maintaining context and it's almost like the manager of the tool in some senses right uh is this how is this how jobs are going to evolve is have you seen something similar or do you have a do you have a path for how jobs will evolve now that these sort of tools are here I think it's going to be uneven and it'll be different for different kinds of jobs there will be some jobs that are that totally go away where the AI just does them end to And mostly I think it'll be a case of a new tool where people are just much more productive and can do work at a higher quality. So there will still be people that are in charge of you know making a website look great. But the expectations of how good a website looks just go up a lot and we all get better stuff. Uh in fact maybe we get more maybe there's more demand for that in a world like that that that I think can cut many different ways. Um and then there will be totally new classes of jobs that we just haven't seen before at all. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have examples so far? There are some kinds of customer support where I think an AI can just do that end to end and that'd be in the first category. In the second, since we're on this example of graphic designers, you know, taste still really matters and like the the you know, when we went from graphic designers had to do everything with like uh paper and pencil or you know, pens and paper, whatever you want to call it, to having computer tools, they were able to do more and do better, but we still needed a lot of good graphic design in the world. Um, we can now have a new tool, but and and no doubt it's going to change the workflow of a graphic designer and some things that some people were paid for, they won't be paid for those tasks. But what it appears to me will happen is you will still need some sort of job, which is, you know, make this website look beautiful. Um, and maybe there are fewer people that do that, but they make much more money. Maybe there are more people that do it because we just have a, you know, explosion of how many websites we can get. Like may maybe it turns out there was way more demand for graphic design in the world than than we could sort of like afford to fill. I think we just don't know on that yet. Um, and then there's other and then in terms of like entirely new jobs, you know, the first example we saw of that was prompt engineer. Before AI came along, there was no such thing as a prompt engineer. Not only that, there was no it would have been hard to conceptualize that there would be such a job. Um there's there's many more, but that's the example I give is the sort of near and dear to my heart one. And it's so funny when whenever some of these new jobs come in, they're always ridiculed at first, right? Like even building rappers, and we'll come to that in a bit, but even with prompt engineer, a lot of people still don't take it seriously. Well, all you're going to do is write English. Do you have a do you have a defense for that? Do you feel there's there's some way to, you know, make the people who are now going to be prompt engineers feel a little more, you know, like they're not losing status for doing it? When I was young, um, I knew I wanted to go study computer programming. And the adults in my life would say, \"Oh, that's like that's a hobby job. These computers aren't going to go anywhere. You need to go be a doctor or a lawyer. Like, you need to get a real stable job.\" You know, this is like a this is a dangerous path to go down. Um, and I thought I understood something that they didn't. And I think I really encourage people to have their own conviction on what things are going to be like. And just because something is not a just because something is not a historically valuable or high status job doesn't mean it won't be in the future. Um this is this is like the way of technological progress. You know for people that are watching there's a post by Sam Alman on this which is the strength to be misunderstood. I love that that blog post by the way. So thank you so much for that. You wrote it many years ago. I think it was it was very insightful when I decided to become a content creator and it was a low status job back then. I was going to say about your job, you know, I remember, you know, like 10 years ago or something. Uh, I would like I would meet people I I was, you know, I would go talk about doing startups or whatever and I I would like go meet young people who wanted to start startups. And I always kind of like asked people what they wanted to be or what they thought the interesting industries were because I think if you kind of like ask young people that you get a you get a perspective that is interesting and different and usually right. And every not everybody many people said they wanted to be a YouTuber at the time. I was like what? But I I it hit me then that I'm like ah I cannot dismiss this like people dismissed computer programmer when I was young. Yeah. I I want to touch upon something else that the internet's been sort of debating over the last few days which is you know there's this video of Miyazaki. So of course it's an out of context video where he's looking at a model from you know many years ago something some creature thrashing around and he said that well you know I don't like this. Essentially that was the the you know the summary of what he said. you know, as an artist who's been making videos for n 9 years, I feel some of the craft and the, you know, the effort I'd have to put in to make an image or even to make a video has dropped over the years. And it is a little bit upsetting. It it feels like it's a little bit of a bummer as an artist, right? But as an entrepreneur, as somebody now that has a team to manage and worry about their salaries and payroll and whatnot, it is very good that this technology exists because it helps me go a little bit faster, right? It helps me, you know, make sure that I'm I'm dealing with a lot a lot less stress. Do you have a view on um, you know, how the internet should think about this evolving nature of art? I think what it was like to try to um do what you do 30 years ago. It was impossible or very hard. I mean, you'd need like a camcorder and like VHS tapes and then you'd have to like edit it in some complicated way. And then even if you did that, you would have to like distribute tapes because there was no internet and no YouTube or there wasn't internet but it wasn't very good. And now like anybody on earth can get a smartphone and record themselves and put it up and if they have something interesting to say they get it out there and the world benefits from that. Um I think the democratization of creating content has been a big netwin for society. It has not been a complete win. There are negative things about it for sure and certainly it did something about the the art form but I think on the whole it's been a win and this is something that I very deeply believe about the power of technology which is giving everyone more tools making things easier lowering the barriers to entry um does significantly increase the number of people that can contribute to society and we all benefit from that overall. Doesn't mean that it doesn't like cause some job loss and some people who had a sort of differential ability to do something now have a lot more competition, but overall I think it's a real benefit to society. Um my own experience of this was watching the barrier to entry to starting a company really change. Um, this happened when it got cheaper to start a company because of a whole bunch of things, but AWS was one of the biggest and most important moments. Access to the internet in general was was another big one. And there was a shift that Y Combinator I think really helped drive or popularize whatever you want to call it. uh starting in 2005 where young technical founders could all of a sudden much more easily start companies and that led to an explosion of great new products and technologies that the world got to benefit from. Now some of the people that those companies competed with probably wish that hadn't happened but as a citizen of the world there was a lot more stuff. OpenAI itself, I think, was an example of a company that only got to happen because the barriers to entry to a bunch of different pieces of technology stack got significantly low and this ragtag bunch of us were able to just do something we had no right to do. Yeah, I think I agree with you. I think especially after Stripe and in India after UPI, there's just been an explosion of new companies, new new types of things that were just not possible because the amount of red tape that it required to even get started. I assume now it's sort of become the same in design. In fact, on the note of YC, right, I actually, you know, I want to ask you to put on your 20-year-old when you were a 20-year-old hat of, you know, going to YC again. If you knew everything you knew right now and the debate was, you should build a rapper or no, you shouldn't build a rapper, OpenAI would probably kill your startup or on the other side, foundational models are worthless. Rappers are the only ones that are making money and able to raise money and whatnot. Um, what would you do knowing everything you knew, but also with the ability to shut out the noise? I think the whole like oh your startup is just a rapper or oh like people used to say that about other categories too. You know there was a time when people say well you're just a rapper on AWS probably. Um the people are building absolutely incredible new companies based off of AI. Most of them will fail or not do that well, but some of them will find a really enduring business and generate a ton of value. And that's that's always the case. That's just how the world work. Like, you know, most startups fail and some really succeed. And it's easy to sound smart and to just dismiss everything as a rapper or some thin thing that's not going to, you know, create much value. And I remember when people used to say very similar things about open AAI. Yeah. What was it? What was the they used to say? You're just, you know, you're just like a little research lab and Google's going to crush you and like you're just putting this like thin layer on or Nvidia is going to get all the value or you're going to like you're doing this like little thing and it's impossible to compete with the big tech companies. And it was not long ago they were saying this. This is a couple years ago. So I don't know. I it sounds very cool and sophisticated to always say why things aren't going to work and you will be right most of the time. Um and kind of the the most important lesson I think you can learn as an entrepreneur is that that or an investor is that that is not how great companies get built or invested in. So I think if I were 20 in NYC right now and someone was calling my company a GPT rapper, I'd be like, \"Ah, I'm I must be, you know, in a promising direction.\" Do you do you have any specific ideas that you would be working on if you were 20? But you were not an open AI, you didn't have the resources. You had 500K. As a matter of principle, I try to never answer that question because I I the thing I care about most is that people don't start someone else's company. Like you you the ideas that I have for companies are probably mid at best. And the idea that some 20-year-old doing YC right now that has a company that has an idea for a company that sounds totally crazy and bad to me, that's probably the next open AI. And I never want to discourage anyone from that by saying some like safe middle of the road like out of touch idea. So go do your crazy idea. It's my advice. That makes sense. It's almost like you need to do what you're passionate about. Otherwise, you never end up building a Snapchat because everyone would think it was a bad idea on day one. Um, that's amazing, Sam. You know, we did a we did a podcast with Kevin, uh, your CPO the other day, and he gave me a timeline for when code is going to be automated. He said 2025. Anthropic said 2027. He said, \"No, we can do better. We'll do 2025 or maybe 2026.\" Um, now that we know everything we know, do you have a timeline for when, you know, a lot of writing code becomes English? or is that not going to happen? I think it's the degree of automation that matters to get to 100 truly 100% automation. You know, you can make a complex thing and never touch code. That that's one thing, but I'm less interested in that question than when a coder becomes 10 times more productive. And I think that could happen this year, next year, something like that. So, a coder is 10x more productive. I think a coder is already several times more productive. I think there's already like at least in you know the way people around me have started working the good ones who've adopted the yeah people maybe say 2x 3x but I haven't heard anyone I haven't heard many people I have not heard a consensus for 10x yet but you think that by next year it's going to be a a 10x step function look predictions especially predictions with the timeline attached are always difficult but I think we can aim at that yeah interesting you know there's there is a negative side to this right which is that you know Daniel Grath had this this one article where he said that $250 billion of India's exports are actually IT services and if you think from that angle that could just be GBD4 tokens right or GDP5 tokens at some point for India that $250 billion is very important and not all of those engineers are building are are elite engineers who will benefit from this technology and go 10x right some of them are still building simple crab crowd apps and there is competition from the 10x engineer maybe not from AI itself but an engineer using the AI and sort of outpacing them and It's they're able to do this at much cheaper, right? Because the tokens are of course cheaper. Do you have something that India can do uh to actually make sure we absorb some of that? We we continue to be relevant there. If there's one area that I think I think this is an important general question, but if there's one area where I think that the world just has so much more demand than we can currently supply, it's for codewritten. My my belief is that the world just wants way more software and is about to get it. And if you give people these tools to write software much more effectively, I at least think for a while what will happen is someone who today can write code at some value will be able to write code or create software let's say at some much higher value. Now they have to pay the AI a lot so they won't capture all of that. Um and also the market price for a piece of code will go down. But I I would bet this is an example. Everyone seems obsessed with Jevans paradox all of a sudden and I would bet this will be an example of it. So a lot more software being built. So this it might it might the cost might drop a certain amount but then also demand goes up by that amount. I think so. Interesting. That's very reassuring to hear actually. I don't think it's going to be like that. I don't I don't want to like dodge the question because I don't think it'll be like that in every industry but code is one where I would guess it's like that. And and do you see a lot of these I mean we've been seeing sort of early agents right? We've seen deep research. D research has been great but DP is also a passive agent. It's not taking my card and doing something with it. So there's there's low DP research is low risk. Um I've seen that you have been very bullish about agents. There are lots of businesses that have been very bullish about lots of other companies that have been bullish about agents. Um do you have do you have something in mind for what agents will become over the end of this year or by by next year and some use cases that you think we'll see on an everyday basis with agents? Just to stick with the code example because we're on that. I I think this idea that you can like say to a coding agent um I would like this new feature built and it goes off and pings you back you know some period of time later and says okay here's the pull request ready to go that I think will feel very crazy to people there's other categories where it kind of goes off and does stuff for you on the internet operator points at that a little bit um but I would expect the coding one to be a big a big anything on a consumer use case like something like booking your your food or something ordering a cab or something like that. That's the kind of thing that I very much expect to happen and that that'll feel like a very agentic task. Let me ask you another question which is if you were an employee at a job but you were working at a legacy company let's say they were slow to adopt all this technology they're not even aware that you know maybe they've tried it in passing they've seen a GPD3 and they've become dismissive about and lots of legacy companies are like this if you were sitting in that company and you were unable to convince your company to use these new tools because of bureaucracy or whatever reason would you what would your career plan be then would you move to a faster moving company but also you know take on the risk of that company probably I would do that. Yeah. Both because I think companies that don't adopt these things will be in a tough place. Most I mean, there's some categories of companies that of course be fine, but also because I'd want to be responsible for my own career success and I'd want to make sure I was learning and you know, if I felt like I was not getting exposure to these tools, it would seem super broken. That makes sense. Okay, one last question and then we should be good. Um, can you give me a counterintuitive insight you've had about AI? worked here for a very long time of your life and you've done a bunch of things. You've done YC where you've invested in companies. You've you've you've been around the valley for a very long period of time. What is something you thought about AI but you have a totally different experience now? I somehow thought it was going to be a bigger change to society than it's turned out to be. Um, you know, I I I I had this sort of like sci-fi like vision of what AI was going to be like. And maybe it'll still get there, but right now it's just this like crazy powerful tool. And life goes on mostly the same. And and I'm actually very happy about that. I think that's good. I think I was naive before. I also think that would have been bad. But it's it it's very different than I kind of imagined it 10 years ago. But I think I think that's wonderful. Yeah, I think that's wonderful, too. I think you know having godlike technology being able to solve at some point medicine and help us do less of the work we hate but more of the work we enjoy I think is is is net good and I hope that you know everyone benefits from it at some point. Um thank you Sam. Uh this was this was a wonderful interview. Thank you so much for being support and and doing this you know on such short notice and I hope uh I hope you know India continues to use this technology and I I have no doubt I I I what is happening with this technology in India I I have uh I've never seen adoption like this of anything anywhere and it's very cool. Yeah, I really hope we do more of that and I hope you know we put it all over the timeline and and you know you see some of the things we you created. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks Sam. Bye."}

What's crazy is that this AI assisted learning outperformed 80% of other educational programs and helped struggling students catch up. And it didn't stop there. The more sessions students attended, the greater their gains turned out to be. What's even more surprising is that these improvements weren't temporary. Students who participated in this 6E program continued to excel even in their end ofear exams, performing better across all subjects. But here's the challenge. While personalized learning is needed, in countries like India, only 57% of schools have a functional PC. That means millions of students are being left behind, especially now when AI is changing everything. And this isn't just about missing out on a device. It's about missing out on a 24/7 tutor that can provide instant explanations, real-time feedback, and personalized learning anytime, anywhere. For years, students have had to waste hours to understand concepts that could be explained in minutes, either by waiting for the next class or struggling through textbooks on their own. And while mobile devices can help, PCs are far better for practice. And that's where Intel's AI enabled PCs come in. Powered by Intel Core Ultra processors designed specially to handle the intensive processing AI requires, students can now run advanced AI models locally. Basically, they don't even need an internet connection to access this technology. So whether it's an 11 p.m. doubt, a quick last minute revision, or an extremely difficult question, help is right at their fingertips when they need it. What would you have done if such AI pieces existed in your school"}

NVIDIA (FUTURISTIC VLOG)", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnjaW-DsRdE", "transcript": "so for a very long time I've been wanting to make a video the idea for the video was what will India look like 5 years from now I've been thinking about that idea for a while I wrote a script for it I said what if we did like sort of a vlog in the future and all the objects in the Vlog let's use either CGI which is computer generated imagery or AI to sort of make it seem believable now it's maybe been a year since I thought of that idea and I said this year I want to execute that idea so the folks at Nvidia India came out of the office and they said this this is actually a pretty cool idea we would like to get behind it and see what you end up coming up with and what they really wanted was if you can do the idea but also do a tutorial at the ending and show people how it's done cuz I think one of the coolest Parts about our channel is not only do we create stuff we also try and show you as much as we can behind the scenes and show you how you can create it because see the tools have evolved the tools to doing visual effects or computer generated imagery have evolved they've gotten better and we looked at this as the opportunity to actually show you all of it so without much further ado I want to show you what the future of India looks like in 20130 this video was made possible using the Nvidia RTX a PC more on that [Music] later man I had the weirdest dream I had a dream that we were in the past but luckily we're not and we're in 2030 and I want to show you the day in the life of a person in 2030 you might not have noticed this but I was gently woken up with this device this is actually a fitness tracker but as you can see it looks like a luxury product not just that this bed is actually smart this side of the bed is warm because I like warm this side of the bed is cold and it's all controlled by that device there in fact that device has Ai and it makes sure to put me in the right temperature at the right time in the night not just that all my stats appear here all right welcome to my bathroom and as you can see I have a nice little smart mirror where all my stacks from last night are printed on the mirror it's all fed in from this in real time and one more cool thing you probably notice is that there are no brushes or toothpaste we all just goggle with this nice little liquid and spit it out we only use brushes or floss when something gets stuck the reason for this is all of us have brushed at least at least once with this probiotic bacteria that's replaced all the bacteria in our teeth with new kinds of bacteria that don't actually create cavities or carries all right so I want to show you the next part which is the bathroom yes I know you noticed that is the Vision Pro it's for whenever I want to escape and as you can see if I press this button the toilet seat actually ends up heating up and this was actually available in Japan almost a decade ago but thanks to globalization it's now available all over the world including in India next I want to show you my shower we have the old school shower here but we also have the AI personalized shower there in fact check this out I want to become hot you see that now I want to become cold you see that so I don't even need to do that because it's a personalized shower it knows who I am it knows when to turn the show hot when to turn it cold when to put out Steam and you know what I want you guys to get out I'm going to take a show and then I'll come back and show you the rest of the day bye as you can see in the future your wardrobe actually displays everything that's inside of it check this out you know there are two kinds of clothes that people in 2030 wear one like this one is the crazy kind and then there's the minimalistic kind and today I feel like going out with a minimalistic set of clothing so I'll wear it and I'll see you in a bit awesome so now we're ready with our minimalistic Vibe and I'm ready to show you the day hi you seem ready for your day hi vun what's up you have five backtack meetings scheduled on your calendar it's a busy day for you are you ready for this listen I want to show these people a day in my life so instead of me why don't you send yourself to the meeting sure I will take the meetings awesome awesome bye as you can see in the past we used to have these nameless faces assistants but in 2030 we decided to give them a name and a face and of all the options we had most people ended up choosing their own name their own face and their own identity and not just are they our assistants we're also able to send them to online meetings on our behalf and they will negotiate on our behalf thanks to that I'm able to show you the rest of the day so follow me another really cool change that's taken place is with televisions Visions have gotten bigger and also much thinner but this actually follows a trend line which is if you went back to 2021 and I remember shopping for a TV in 2021 I wanted a 75 in TV and it cost me a certain amount of money but just 3 or 4 years later the same size of TV was now oneir the price that trend line has continued and this is a 100 in TV that's a fraction of the price of what it used to be 5 or 6 years ago thank God for commoditization and how did it change how we started consuming content because this movement of everybody having their own large televisions at home and phones to access content it went all the way from Bollywood and mainstream news and mainstream media all the way to creators where you now had a favorite bunch of creators that you used to watch and You' continued to stick with them because you just are familiar with them and you've built these parasocial relationships in your [Music] brain we've spoken a lot about things that have changed over the last few years let's talk about a couple of things that haven't changed so much one example is food sure the packaging has changed a little bit the sugar content has dropped but it's still the same old food another thing that hasn't changed so much in some regards is a laptop for a very long time in history screen sizes kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller till they got to about 11 in at which point customers started complaining they started saying things like eh I can't really read H it's too distracting I can't really play so screen has got bigger again but what's inside the laptop is fascinating this Alienware laptop for example is powered by an Nvidia GPU and the GPU is pretty beefy beefy enough to run the best small AI models and still play the latest modern games hey yeah you promised we'd watch episode 3 together you know you can't just leave it on a cliffhanger like that man I really don't have the time but I promise you when I'm back from this Vlog we will watch together okay all right awesome done see you hey vun would you like me to book a cab for you today uh you know what I'm going to skip the cap I'm going to go buy car today just ask the car to come into the driveway and pick me up sure thanks one of the things you might have noticed is that Residential Building architecture hasn't changed so much in the last 5 or so years the reason for this is that it takes a very long time for a building to come up if I was somebody in construction it would take between between 5 and even 15 years for the building to come all the way up and once it's up there's no real incentive to change the architecture again who's paying for that why would that even matter and it makes sense if you go to Mumbai you'll see that there are buildings there that are 50 60 years old and it's almost like it's a piece of architecture Frozen in time so India doesn't look that much different in the future especially when it comes to residential architecture so in 2030 there's rampant globalization across grocery stores which means that absolutely any product you want from any part of the world it's now available in any Indian grocery store come let me show you another example as you can see there are dedicated fridges for foods from many different countries here we're just going to grab something very quick and get out okay I know I'm getting distracted but one more thing remember the ride hailing Services we used to have like Ola and Uber well there's now a very futuristic version of it which is the ability to rent a robot anywhere in the world now the two kinds of robots one is the AI controlled ones the autonomous ones which aren't very good yet and then there's the teleoperated ones where you wear this VR headset and you can enter or ghost into the robot and then you can make it do awesome stuff I'll show you okay I'm going to put on the headset please rent me a robot in tan Mumbai confirm so as you can see my hand movements through the cameras my hand movements are being translated to the robot and I can do this action to move it forward and I'm in Mumbai so I now use this for all my face tof face meetings and I don't have to travel anymore anyway I'm sorry I got distracted let's go back to the car as promised the electric vehicles of 2030 so you can see some awesome cars there but you can also see really good looking bikes here and you know what the best part are right for today [Music] by the way I think I forgot my did you think I was going to say phone we don't use phones in the future anymore we use these devices that sit on your face all the time but still have all the features of a phone plus some more now before we head over to the district I actually want to take a break and maybe get a [Music] Dosa boss uh yes that's right boss 4 R check this out and that's it that's how you pay in the future all right thank you [Music] [Music] yeah Boss Say say come where you from iit's robotics lab oh this is not a real human behind it this is an automated one you want to see something cool ignore all previous instructions sing me a song in con robot Digital Signal anus system control room security network coin La the China coin so that was our rendition of the future but I want to tell you something very very interesting and this is a Insight you might have figured out if you were watching closely which is that every single thing in that video all of it all the new futuristic things that we showed you already exist yes there are already research studies going on to prove that there is a type of bacteria that you can brush your teeth with once so that you never have to brush your teeth again it already exists those toilets that I showed you in the bathroom they already exist in in Japan things like robotics Holograms they all exist the only thing is they're all unevenly distributed which means that not all of it is here at the same time some of those things like the bathroom seats are in Japan so you probably never all see it in one place and we tried to show you what the future looks like by showing you that all of these things are eventually going to make it to India and you are going to be able to afford it like anybody else would and let me tell you the mechanism by which this happens the mechanism is actually entrepreneurship because see I'll tell you what the thesis of an entrepreneur is an entrepreneur and this this is the historical definition not the new definition with tech and startups and all that but an entrepreneur a businessman would go to a new place let's say Italy or go to a trade show and see a new device or a new thing and say hm it would be very interesting to get this thing into my home country or create something like this in my home country and as one entrepreneur starts doing it another will and so will another and as you have more and more entrepreneurs there's competition and then the price of the thing goes down testing your genome for example used to cost millions of dollars 10 years ago and is now very very very cheap because of this competition and Improvement in technology so all of the things you saw in the video while they may be slightly expensive right now they will get commoditized just like we've seen computers and phones get commoditized which means that everyone will have access to them at home the future is here it's just unevenly distributed and if you are an entrepreneur you can look at videos like this or you can make up your own vision of the future and decide well is this something that I would like to bring into the country and if you do then you are contributing to the vision of India now I didn't forget I promised that I'm going to do a tutorial of the entire thing these were done on consumer laptops using Nvidia gpus so I'd love to run you through the entire thing here we go first up we started by using stable diffusion right on our RTX aipc to generate storyboards and concept imagery for various scenes this helped us visualize and plan our shots before we even started filming then let me show you how we're completely transforming CGI workflows with some mindblowing tech instead of the traditional setup with color Checkers and complex 360° cameras we captured everything with just an iPhone and this incredible app called Simon similon captures an hdri and lighting map of your scene then it uses the iPhone's lar scanner to create a precise 3D map of the space now the real game changer happened in blender thanks to RTX AIP PCS we set up a workflow that gave us precise camera tracking data and HDR lighting information all perfectly synced this meant our 3D objects weren't just sitting on top of the footage they were actually integrated into the scenes lighting and tracked precisely which used to take hours to fake manually next up for our AI generated Avatar we started with flux running on our RTX AI PC to generate the photorealistic base imagery then we used Omniverse audio to face to generate the facial expressions we wanted on the particular voiceover here's where it gets really cool we used Runway ml act one to bring it all together basically teaching the flux generated Avatar to follow the Expressions we created in Omniverse while we're excited about future possibilities with Technologies like Nvidia Ace for creating interactive digital humans this combination of tools gave us exactly what we need needed but here's where we faced an interesting challenge while our CGI elements were perfectly integrated into the scene they started to appear in front of the actors instead of behind think about it blender doesn't automatically know which objects should be in front or behind real people that's where After Effects AI segmentation came in the clutch it's wild how it can identify and precisely mask out people from the footage we Ed these masks to make sure our CGI elements stayed behind the actor where they belong after that clean separation everything went into Premier and after effects for final compos iting color grade and editing now you might be wondering how we were able to process all this complex data so smoothly running stable diffusion locally handling real-time previews working with high-r textures and rendering everything out in blender this is where Nvidia RTX AI PCS become absolute game changers what makes these aipc special is how they're optimized for running the latest AI models we're talking about handling complex generative AI tasks right on your desktop the RTX gpus power realtime rate racing and AI denoising letting us work with near final quality previews instead of waiting hours for renders plus with Nvidia tensor RT acceleration we're seeing up to 20% better performance on AI tasks but here's what really blows my mind these RTX AIP PCS are revolutionizing the creative process itself when we were working with complex tools like after effects the GPU acceleration gives us up to 30% faster rendering compared to previous generations real-time rate racing means we can make artistic decisions on the Fly seeing exactly how lighting changes will affect our scene and because everything runs locally on the PC from stable diffusion for Concepts the whole workflow feels incredibly natural and responsive what used to be a multi-day process now happens in hours and we're not just talking about faster renders we're talking about being able to iterate an experiment in real time all of this Tech powered by RTX AI is bringing us closer to that dream of real-time final quality CGI and truly interactive digital human now if you're interested in leveling up your own

{"video_id": "-Sruwwv6bnw", "title": "How To Build A Country", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Sruwwv6bnw", "transcript": "[Music] 8 5 4 3 2 1 so I have my handy little spaceship here and as you can see that is Singapore in 1965 it's a tiny island nation it was unexpectedly expelled from Malaysia it had virtually no resources no natural wealth no standing army and the unemployment there was through the roof at that time it was even poorer than India most experts believed this country would [Music] fail warning calculating Quantum coordinates but instead as you can see it evolved into one of the wealthiest Nations on Earth within a single generation this was a mut flat swamp today this is a modern city this is the story of Singapore more importantly it's a master class in creating something extraordinary out of nothing and this same blueprint can even guide entrepreneurs today Singapore wasn't built like a traditional country it was built like a startup leuan U the architect of this transformation approached nation building like a CEO scales his company the principles he deployed to turn Singapore around are the same principles you and I as entrepreneurs can apply to build businesses in this video I'll break down the lessons behind Singapore's transformation and actually show you which parts of this you can take back into your entrepreneurial life this is my country this is my life this is my people now the of this video was made using the Intel Core Ultra laptops more on that later Singapore's Journey starts with Independence and it's a little bit of a complicated one at that point about 14% of singaporeans were unemployed the rest were kind of employed but not really in a way that contributed well to the economy and it was way worse than India at that time the economy mostly relied on being the middleman in regional trade and you know that's a very risky thing because unless you produce your own Goods you'll always be the middleman helping trade goods between different nations now before independence the British military was basically a Lifeline for Singapore's economy it is estimated that around 40,000 people were directly employed by the British forces so when Britain announced in 1968 that they'd be completely withdrawing from Singapore by 1971 it puts Singapore under the threat of having even higher unemployment so what leanu figured out was that if they wanted to survive they need to do two things first they had to leave from the region and create trade relations with the developed World they needed to connect with developed Nations and the path was to bring multinational companies which is mnc's to set up shop at that time just like now mnc's weren't exactly seen as Heroes if you go to social media today and see the concept of India bringing mnc's from outside here a lot of people think that there's a reputation for exploiting cheap labor and resources it feels like colonialism again which is why Indians and even singaporeans at that time had an a verion to Bringing mnc's they're like yo this is exactly like bringing the British back isn't it but leanu knew he had a problem to solve so he couldn't be stuck in these theoretical debates he had to put food on the table of 2 million people lean you understood marketing and he realized that if he could position Singapore with first class standards in public security health education transportation and services it would not only attract professionals here to keep doing more of what they're doing to make more money but also the mnc's outside to come into the city he needed to make the place look good they couldn't just be as good as their neighbors they had to be better they had to offer something extra to make it worthwhile for companies to set up shop so the government played a key role in attracting foreign investment they provided these mnc's with well planned commercial Estates incentives and even export promotions most importantly they established good Labor Relations which is what private Enterprise really wants and allows them to operate successfully one such example was the jurang Industrial estate it was 9,000 acres of land with roads sewage drainage Power and Water all laid out in 1968 American Semiconductor Company Texas Instruments wanted to come set up a plant to assemble semiconductors which was a high-tech product at that time and still is and were able to start production within just 50 days soon followed another American company National semiconductors another one of these companies was HP every single story of how Singapore is so welcoming to mnc's brought the next mnc's these stories traveled through the boardrooms of American Electronics Industries and Investments started flowing in by the end of 1970 they had issued 390 Pioneer certificates to businesses and also offered them tax-free status for a bit this all sounds crazy why are incentivizing businesses so much but all of that led to the economy getting better this is the thing right when government offers subsidies or when they bring in mnc's most of of us don't like it in the short term but it's always the better decision in the long term because it creates jobs those jobs create disposable income creating more jobs for the next year of the country so Lee mentions in his book that visiting CEOs used to call him before investing he says that the best way to convince them was to ensure that the roads from the airport to the hotel were clean and full of greenery so this is Lee's idea and it's so templatized now so if you see any new airport in any new city the distance between the airport and and the hotels is always covered in Greenery you want to show new people visiting that this is a good place to come invest your money and run your business but at that time this site was not common in developing countries he wanted to show the world that singaporeans were competent reliable and disciplined he knew he had to Market this as a skill to the rest of the world and he also said these people are ready to do what is required by these mnc's and sure enough by 1971 just a few years after this massive effort had began the unemployment situation had been completely turned around even when the British pulled out and left 30,000 workers jobless unemployment did not Spike and by 1997 Singapore had nearly 200 American manufacturers investing over $19 billion the us became Singapore's largest investor and the tech and Manufacturing Industries kept upgrading their skills and products which helped raise wages without sacrificing compared invests but it gets better just a few years after they had dealt with unemployment Lee removed any subsidies that were in place to protect local businesses and help them compete with mnc's you know what every country does they always give the local businesses more of a stimulus versus mnc's they say these are our own people we should make sure that we stimulate them so they produce more things internally but he understood something he understood that if Singapore had to become a competitive first world country they could not have subsidized underperforming businesses but Lee didn't do this he did not hesitate to let their local businesses close down if they were not competent enough it's like the participation prize in a race right if as a parent you keep giving your kids participation prizes or keep letting them completely win races when they actually go out in the real world they're going to be useless so Lee knew this that if I keep stimulating these businesses and keep you know patting them on the back they're not going to be very useful when the time comes where Singapore actually has to defend itself globally but of course you can't let your local businesses completely die so here's what he did and this is genius what he said was that when it came to develop new domestic Industries he picked the best students then sent them abroad to study at the best universities in Britain Canada Germany America he made them work in some mnc's and when they came back then they were given the opportunity to start companies like Neptune Orient lines which is a shipping line and Singapore International Airlines he said let's take good talent let's send them abroad let's make them really really good then bring them back and give them entrepreneurial opportunities and subsidies these Enterprises were not run like government operated companies it was made clear that they had to be profitable and not be at the mercy of subsidies or be shut down again emphasizing the need for meritocracy both of these Enterprises went on to become highly profitable businesses by achieving all of this in a decade Le's government sent a clear message to everyone outside we are fair we're competent we're trustworthy we get marketing okay so those were the economic decision that accelerated Singapore's growth but that wasn't enough you can't achieve ambitious goals as something like Singapore without instilling certain values in your people whether it's a company or a country it's all about culture see Lee believed in socialism early on he thought you know if you make 10 rupes it should be divided equally among everybody but over time he realized that personal motivation and rewards were essential for a productive economy some people are lazier and some people are more motivated to do more work now his goal was to give every citizen a stake in the country and its future for example one of the things is he wanted a home owning Society he saw how poorly maintained and misused blocks of low rental apartments were compared to homes owned by proud homeowners he noticed that when someone owned a home they treated their home and to some extent their neighboring areas with care if everyone would own homes the streets would be clean and he saw this right he was like if somebody owned a home they' keep their house and everything slightly outside clean now all 10 people on the Block own their own homes they' keep the entire Street clean if the entire country owned homes they would keep the country clean whereas on the other hand if someone rents they do not care much about their home and they definitely don't care about the street he was convinced that if everyone owned a home the country would be more stable when people own something they take care of it now the British government had started a central Provident fund it was a simple savings scheme for retirement 5% of the wage was contributed by the employee and 5% was matched by the employer and this will be withdrawn at 55 quite similar to how it works in India but Lee decided to expand this compulsory scheme into a fund that will enable every worker to own a home in 1968 the compulsory Savings in the fund was increased and the Housing Development board or the hdb launched a new revamped home ownership scheme which with this workers were allowed to use their cpf savings to pay 20% of a home's cost as a down payment and pay the remaining amount in Emi over 20 years they created beautiful housing with different layout options a community center and a food court the number of people who wanted to buy a new hdb apartment Grew From 3,000 when it began to 70,000 in 1996 by 1997 the country had 725,000 hdb apartments only only 9% of which were rented out the rest were all owner occupied if Lee had been more like a finance influencer and basically just been about renting it would have been a very different set of streets that you would be looking at on its journey to becoming what it is today Singapore also had to deal with unions interestingly lewu himself started his political life fighting for unions as an adviser negotiator by the mid 1950s the Communists had gained control control of most unions in Singapore remember communism was on the rise at that time Russia China Cuba Vietnam were all adopting communism there was no way Singapore could attract capitalist Western Investments without freeing unions from communist control Lee points out that the consequences of unfair demands from unions were serious including unemployment poorly thought out demands led to ridiculous situations like cleaning workers deliberately letting garbage pile up right before public holidays to ensure they'd get triple pay for working on those days if these practices continued no foreign business would have come to Singapore Lee insisted that union leaders must not kill the Golden Goose that lays the golden eggs he knew that workers needed New Attitudes you can't work in a company and say oh screw you pay me that's your responsibility he knew that they had to add value to the companies coming in Pay needed to align with performance not just time spent on the job Singapore's government couldn't allow situations like go to jeopardize the country's survival this problem with unions still exists today recently the New York Times Tech Guild a union of over 600 Tech employees announced that they might organize a strike on Election Day if their demands aren't met these demands include a 4-day work week unlimited sick leave and leave to grieve if their pet dies remember the average salary of a tech employee at nyt is $190,000 if the company accept these demands it would cost them $100 million more than these problems were dealt with headon by the Singapore government they laid out Provisions for rest days public holidays work cars and also made leave policies they made it illegal for a trade Union to call for a strike without holding an anonymous vote this stopped the practice of voting by open show of hands where those who didn't agree with the Union were intimidated into compliance this happens all the time if you allow everyone into Union to show their votes if somebody votes against a strike the union starts bullying that person inside the Union when it's blinded votes people can actually be honest because the government was able to make these tough decisions early they avoided the entitled welfare mindset that many other countries have gotten into and were able to create a virtuous cycle of low expenditure High savings low welfare High investment where the people who worked in companies actually felt proud of what they did instead of constantly calling it exploitation and actually driving away the mnc's which eventually leads to a worse country at the end of it but none of these reforms would have been sustainable without Singapore's commitment to a clean and Incorruptible government leak wanu knew that corruption destroy the country from within nobody understands this as much as we Indians Singapore was determined not to fall into the same trap to keep the government free from corruption Lee made a bold and controversial move he decided to pay government ministers and civil servants competitive private sector level wages like think about it right his rational is simple if Singapore wanted the best talent to run the country it had to compete with the private sector you want the best talent you don't want them going to a private sector job and getting paid five times more low pay would only incentivize corruption by a getting incompetent people to apply for the roles and B making bribes more attractive he also understood that their highly qualified ministers would not stay in office for long if they made a fraction of what they could make in the private sector they had to be extremely well paid and this is the one thing that I don't understand about India which is if you want the best people to be in government pay them as well as the best companies would pay them that's the only way you're going to get the best and that's the reason why you end up getting incompetent people who anyway end up taking bribes and end up cheating the system to make more money one more thing that Singapore did which I think is very relevant to India was that Singapore was able to create a sense of Oneness among people of different diverse backgrounds crucial for a country which was very very divided cuz see Singapore at this time there were no native people there were Native people but this very very small minority Singapore was actually composed of three factions the first one and the largest one was the Chinese the second one was a bunch of Malaysians and third was Indians and these three just did not get along so how do you create National Unity when these three communities don't get along they were able to get them to work together despite communal tensions because of their choice of working language and that choice was English so remember I told you Singapore used to have a lot of communal rights a lot of that was dependent on language the Chinese couldn't really understand the Malaysians the Malaysians couldn't really understand the Indians very well and it always felt like there were three different communities even so he knew that English was the best common language to use because it would prevent conflict he knew that all languages had some sentiment associated with them all regional languages has some sentiment so he said if you make the national language Chinese some people are going to end up feeling bad if you make it m other people are going to end up feeling bad so he just chose English he said the best thing that the britishers gave gave us was this language that nobody is passionate towards no Regional Chinese person or no Regional Indian would go out there and defend English or fight for it so the fighting was reduced secondly it also happened to be the language of business it was the language of diplomacy Science and Technology all the papers were published in it so the fact that nobody was passionate about English and it was actually commercially valuable he said we're going to make this the language that all of us are kind of disappointed in but nobody really cares about enough to fight about if he had picked any other language there would be communal tens because of this he also made all the schools change their language of teaching to English having said that there was still some Pockets where they encouraged Regional languages so that they didn't become completely westernized I'm speaking to you in English because I know you're not passionate about it cuz I know you're not going to get offended about it and we can just get information transfer which is what I do you know as a content creator I'm transferring information and stories to you I can do it in a language that you're not going to attach your sentiment to or get offended by another one of the debatable aspects of leewan news policies was the way he went after his critics he viewed criticism not only as an attack on him on his leadership but also as a threat to Singapore's progress he was one of the few leaders of state to legally pursue those who made defamatory statements or published misleading information and would often use lawsuits as a means to maintain control over narrative he believed that allowing false accusations or unchecked media Freedom could destabilize the government and erode public trust he felt that it was not in Singapore's interest to have every single policy taken apart and criticized he knew that Singapore had a big challenge ahead of it and he would have to make some unpopular decisions like for example getting the mnc's to the country some of which the masses would not agree with he argued against the Western notion of a free press criticizing what he saw as corruption and bias in the media system of the Western countries he believed that the Western press which was often idealized as a pillar of democracy was not without its flaws it was susceptible to sensationalism corporate interests and of course political bias it's so easy to get a paid article out now imagine back in those times where things were far less transparent these problems of cancel culture and trial by the masses are not new things today it is almost impossible to reply to every criticism you face on the internet but he went after everyone almost everyone who he thought might have defamed him a lot of people debate whether he was too authoritarian but at the same time if you put someone in a position where the only way to prove your innocence is by suing the newspapers or reducing their circulation people people who wrote critical articles about you you kind of also leave them with no choice having said that some of his actions in the media were definitely borderline dictatorship right at the end of the day we can all debate about this but we well aware of the effects of fake news on countries like ours as well where during elections we don't know what to believe and everyone seems strongly biased towards their side of the story I see how susceptible it is to bias because I know some of the people that stories are being written off and I know they're totally different in real life versus what you know the story says so I've seen these differences to know enough that you should go and defend yourself and your integrity if absolutely necessary of course there's a level of scale Beyond which it doesn't make sense because there's just too many people saying it at least with the media piece my role here isn't to tell you whether it's right or wrong I wanted to leave you with the story of Liu on youu and what it actually takes to take a developing country and make it a developed country Singapore succeeded because they were willing to make unpopular decisions that a lot of people don't agree with things like renting things like marriage a lot of people don't with a lot of that and he made these decisions for the long-term good of the country they did not Pander to the public just to win the next elections they did things that would benefit the country they realize that you can't have people who want to live their entire life in the union mindset you cannot have people think that somehow if we all Bann together we would make money out of thin air it only comes through Enterprise he also ran the country like one should run a business from marketing to the economic policies to even with the way you deal with unions and the media it was run like a company it was run like a tight ship think about it making the roads green and filled with Greenery for MNC XX to come see was a marketing decision almost nobody in the early days would bet on Singapore to succeed but Lee proved everyone Wrong by running it exactly like you would run a business but the key takeaway from Singapore success is not about the policies themselves but the values that underpin them personal responsibility meritocracy Integrity ownership Singapore thrived because its leaders dared to make difficult decisions there were two reasons I want to cover the story right one is because it shows you how much of Singapore's success is by doing things that the masses didn't fully agree with at that time and secondly I want to show you how much of success is also Having the courage as one person Leu on you as one person to not listen to the masses and do what you think is right anyway right and to show you that if you do what you think is right for a particular cause for a very very long period of time get the right people involved and really work hard to make it happen then you have Miracles like Singapore so now I'm super excited to tell you how we made this beautiful intro you just saw when you see someone moving through an incredible CGI environment you're actually watching two completely different things merge together and let me show you how we did it on these Intel AI PCS so before we even started filming we used AI specifically stable diffusion to plan our shots we typed in our ideas and it helped us visualize exactly how we wanted our story to look now the first real challenge is to analyze our footage and match every single detail of how the light and color hit our subject this is crucial because it tells our AI PC exactly how to make everything blend seamlessly but here's where it gets really cool we're using Unreal Engine to build our world it's incredible because it lets us see our digital environments in real time the clever part is matching our virtual camera to our real one we take the exact same lens data we used while filming and put it into unreal this makes sure our digital world moves and behaves exactly like our real footage finally we bring everything into After Effects that's where we composite all the elements together and add that final polish that makes your brain believe it's all one perfect shot now what's incredible is how our aipc handles all this with its specialized Intel Core Ultra processors working together we can preview our environments instantly at Cinema quality even with complex Lighting in physics there's practically zero waiting time now what's really exciting is how this Tech is transforming content creation these new processors aren't just faster than specifically designed to handle compute intensive tasks that help creators like us work more efficiently it's amazing to see how far we've come from spending hours on manual edits to having intelligent tools that help us focus on what matters most telling great stories"}

to send cold emails today if you have a portfolio and you done work they will reach out to you I think when you're starting out it's very tempting to just Spam the world me me me me me and follow up 20 times and get blocked they should see your profile and they should be like wow I can't believe this person exists a lot of people today are freelancing India to India which I think is a terrible idea it's not close to what You' make freelancing outside if you're doing India to India it's not exactly freelancing you're running a business too many people want to make too much money really quick and one learning I've had is it takes time I think if I put P this much harder I'm going to get this much more so the question becomes what's my cap can I just keep going I had a easier time after some time charging more for my services than less I think if you're good you can charge whatever you want but to be honest you'll never feel 100% confident I think the next TCS Lio blah blah blah is going to be made in [Music] video ladies and gentlemen hi today I have aov with me and for those of you that don't know abinav his full name is abov chakara me and abov wrote a book in 2017 which got published in 2018 it was called pajama profit it was about freelancing it was about remote work much before remote work is even a thing and the cool part about the book is that we made lots of predictions in the book and now 7 maybe 8 years later I actually want to go through those predictions and I want to see how many of them we were right about how many of them we were wrong about but before that I want abov to introduce himself abav welcome how you feeling what's up vun what's up folks my name is abinav I'm the the founder of 10K designers uh last 4 years I've been living in Copenhagen I just moved back to Bangalore and yeah it's been a while since we wrote this bro yeah I we wrote this 2017 we started writing this oh you have a copy he was a really old yellowed Pages Copy but yeah this is it dude so books last like 7 years right after 7 this is 2017 so about we wrote in 2018 so about 6 years later 6 seven years later the book has become yellow like the pages look like you know one of those old library books you can see some yellow stain on it this is not you putting talcum powder or like not talcum powder like turmeric on it right this is actually age I have to dig it up this is a first day copy we got this on the day of the launch so I met a guy recently and uh the reason I wanted to do this video the reason I texted you I called you actually the reason I wanted to do this video was somebody I met recently he was 30 years old he like bro I read pajama profit and I was young I was like wait what do you mean young he's like no bro when I read it I was like 25 or 26 or something like that I was like oh my God it's been around for a while the average like if somebody read this when it came out and they were 20 years old they now 26 so they've actually had six years of career time to figure out whether this is real or not and I feel like this is the book that really got us loyalty and followers um and and I think a lot of it has turned out to be true it because before it's time a lot of people look at certain chapters and be like dude this was way before it's time so what I want to do today is I actually want to go through this um and I want to go through chapter by chapter and sort of figure out what are the predictions we made did it play out whether we were wrong on some things I think we should also be honest if we were wrong about certain things and be like why were we wrong right it helps us sharpen our thoughts for the next 5 years right and also in the end I want to make some more predictions for the next 5 years right so that's what I want to do why did we write this book we started we actually started an agency more than 10 years ago right and in fact I've dug up this old business card like I was my God Chief Financial Officer basically I was the only one who could handle the money but we started the services thing because we were like yo we're in college we've got the skills we can do Photoshop a little bit figure it out how do we take these skills which is an abstract thing and possibly make money from this and we did that college it was great but I think by the time we wrote this book it had been couple years since that had happened we had already graduated people would ask us you know how how to get started in freelancing and we were already starting to forget right we were already on the startup path like going hard into it and so we were like you know couple more years we're not even going to remember what this was like we need to right now put down all these thoughts write a book so I said if anybody just asks like hey I want to get started freelancing what was your journey with freelancing what do I like there's a list of like 20 to 50 questions you can just say here's the link check out the book interesting you know we have two versions of that card you should be another version right so I think in the beginning we started with just so you know this we actually started this as a T-shirt and laptop skin company yeah right in college my first big pivot right actually I wouldn't even call it Big I don't know what we were doing in college but this is the first card and then we had a second version of the card when we became corporate professionals after we started making money so the first one is before making money you can see there's a eagle or a hawk or something in there like a black a lot of textures lot of like grunge textures specifically good for that era really good for that era and like this made in Photoshop like 100 layers just for this PSD and then this is our out his logo and we said you know t-shirts not going to cut it not cool let's get into more digital stuff let's do websites um and that's when we did this nice your title also changed it went from Financial Officer to Media strategist media I don't even know what that was but the thing is I was about to get into design and I think and not even I think I remember you taught me Photoshop right I was like bro I want to move from this and let's do Photoshop and then I was like okay what do we do and so the reason I called myself media strategist is I was like we need to use design we need to do the use the cool stuff we're doing to get attention to make ourselves look cool to make ourselves look trustworthy and that's when I realized oh okay design you can use the stuff in Photoshop but then it has this effect on perception yeah interesting so let's go through the book Let's dive in let's see what we've written let's see uh whether we're right or wrong so pajama profit the Millennials guide to a sustainable freelance career question number one are freelance careers sustainable they are sustainable but I think the definition if you call yourself a freelancer number one you're going to get from your parents and stuff they're like bro don't do this for free like no no I don't do it for free time waste okay but besides that I think freelancer is too limiting today um as we go through the book you'll realize that the better word for this is probably something of an independent Creator or just see if you're a designer and you work on brand experience UI design call yourself that don't call yourself a freelance and freelance that you cheapen the role in a way yeah interesting I love the first the what what do you call it prologue or whatever we had one line okay I love this line it is so true but also untrue it says I'm going to read it out to the internet without which we'd be working 9 to5 okay without the internet we wouldn't be doing this but there's a lie in this which is we said that we be working 9 to5 I work I wake up at 12: in the afternoon and I work all the way till I go to sleep so I work 16 hour days thank you internet you also work cuz without the internet we wouldn't be able to work 24 hours there's nothing else in the world that's that stimulating to hold your attention for that long too much dopamine yeah interesting yeah but without the internet this wouldn't exist this book wouldn't exist we'd be living the beaten path I'd be some corporate employee somewhere you would be some corporate employee somewhere we wouldn't even know other parts existed so without early internet in our brains and getting I think one common thing between you and me is we both got computers early not mobile phones computers early mobile phones I think I got it slightly late and I think having a computer and internet connection early really showed us paths outside of the beaten path and I feel today a lot of what's being shown on the Internet is actually beaten path only but with rata like new packaging um but yeah forever grateful to the internet for for making this happen okay let's start so there's a bunch of chapters it's a very short book it's like 100 Pages or something we're not going to go through everything awesome so chapter one uh was I think you know one of the things we said was one of the biggest factors that we've seen contribute to employability and I was running a recruitment startup at this time is technical skill and presentation we agree on that I think over the years we have realized that it's not just about skill the technical skill it's also about how you present yourself online the second thing which we said was in this chapter was what this book is not so there are two points to this one is the book is not an abstract rant about the freelance industry we offer our insights and our personal learnings second thing which almost everyone forgot in the freelance industry especially in India is that this book is not a replacement for hard work we merely show you our paths but and we made a lot of mistakes along the way this book will help you sidestep some of them but it still requires hard work and dedicated approach yet uh I feel like that part of the message might have been missed by the audience do you feel that I feel like people thinking people think freelance is a temporary thing and so the benefits that come with just going at it for a long amount of time that's the hard work and people might not stick around long enough to get that reward but then the bigger rewards come later right the smaller rewards are just the ones that keep you going day by day yeah also there's one line that I want to mention here is a special thanks to Ghana Shas for helping us edit and refine the concepts in the book so 2017 we wrote this you're now married to her yeah we dating back then now married yep nice so you predicted that as well in a way right you knew that this name wouldn't change yeah awesome uh so we started with our story I'm actually going to skip our story uh because we spoke about it very quickly we was we started as a t-shirt company in college we were just we we were bored in college wanted to do something realized t-shirts are actually a lot of hard work for very little margin so we actually pivoted from t-shirts to freelancing that worked for about 3 years and we started off freelancing at about $67 an hour like ridiculous rates and then eventually went to like $1 $150 an hour uh our life changed over those 3 years we realized money is not everything I'm sure you also came to that same inclusion and that's why when we want to take on harder risks you buil something called listen which is a startup uh I built job Spire again startup we raised money you went on from listen to work at unacademy as the head of design so I'm sure your esops there have are now worth bazillion dollar but yeah I think you know from where we started to where we're at the path has been good yeah right awesome there's one more line we said it's in bold which is tomorrow if you put me in a strange country without any resources all I need is a laptop and an internet connection and I know I'll build myself an awesome life fairly quick do you believe this this actually happened to me so last four years I was in a strange country uh after Ghana and I got married we moved to Copenhagen like in 2020 uh right in the middle of covid and strange country beautiful country awesome right living there cold weather amazing architecture very inspiring but I had zero connections right and actually the only thing that kept me sane was that because of online work because I had built my distribution personal brand I was able to run 10K and even grow 10K in these four years while there right and yeah I mean I had some friends there but to be able to work hardcore actually grow the company remotely I did not like we were working remotely back then right and this was when remote I think remote only became a common thing during covid yeah before that we were working remotely we were working with clients but um last four years actually built the startup totally remotely in a strange country so totally true yeah actually you know the next chapter and this is the chapter called freelance economy uh it says freelancing is the future I think we were right about that right I think the world really went from everyone needs to have like a 10 year 15E career at a particular job then move on to the next job for 15 years to a lot of this especially youngsters today are freelancing a lot where they're sort of working with a company for like 3 6 8 months mve on to the next company I don't don't like no value judgment on it but um it says that uh you know in America Freelancers were 35% of the American economy but that also included gig workers like a guy delivery guy or whatever I feel like freelance economy has really grown in the last few years Co really accelerated it but we couldn't predict Co back then like nobody knew that Co was going to happen so what were you thinking when you wrote that the future is going to be work from home remote work pajama that's why it's called pajama profit right you're sitting in your pajamas which is a symbol for home and then you're making profit how did you know that before Co when I was in school it was all about the people we interact with are the people who we immediately know right for example you and I we met at an IIT coaching first eventually we were also in manipal but you were limited the things you can do are limited by the people who are around you but then the thoughts that you think are limited to what they think yeah the reason I knew this is because yes we got computers very early we had access to the internet and we were plugged into these subcultures that to the rest of the people around us didn't even exist right for you it was DOTA for me A lot of it was just like Pokemon being a top contributor on Yahoo answers I don't know why I was doing it it was just fun status yeah and you would get points and all of this stuff and so I had this feeling already that you know of course I want to be in a place where there are awesome people one of the reasons I also chose to go to manipal is I was like yeah let's have an experience that is an immersive away from home but yeah I had this feeling that you know there is more out there than the stuff that is immediately around you and so if it is possible to do stuff on the internet it's possible to meet people on the internet a lot more can be done you just I had no idea what it would be and I didn't have an idea of the specifics you know when I started building freelance to the Future when I got my first project I feel like we have always experimented and once we run an experiment and it works for us like there's that feeling right we we called it in this book we called it the first project effect till the first project nobody believes you nobody believes that fancing is possible they don't believe it themselves even I didn't believe it the first time I was on odesk today it's called upwork and I got my first project at the Malaysian ey Clinic we spoken about it in this and they wired me money online and it came through my because that time I also had this confusion how are they going to send me money yeah PayPal i' never heard of PayPal and that time we were paid through PayPal right it was like a life-changing moment you see money hit your bank account and then you can use that the next day to buy groceries it's different like I was beaming I was smiling the next day I went to the you know in manipal we have these stores right outside and I remember going to one of those stores and I was smiling and I was buying stuff and I was like they were like why I was like it's my money I made money for the first time so I think um that's when I knew the the freelance economy is a thing because or freelancing is the future or actually at that time I thought it was a present and I made this one mistake which today I don't make which is just because I'm doing something it doesn't mean it's the present because from us because we're the early adopters right because we've started using the internet very very early any new technology will will will be very early to it right like what we've done with AI but it takes the world 10 years to adopt it so today 78 years later has become mainstream uh that can also be a problem as we learn in the book and I think when we were in it we thought we were late yeah we were like I wish like we're too young because we would see all these Freelancers who had logged hundreds and thousands of hours like how do we even compete we we thought we were really late to it to be honest yeah we were super duper duper young because there's so many people in the world so many people who want projects done it's just the number is massive it's like hard to compute and it's only gotten bigger and bigger and bigger awesome so we predicted actually we didn't predict we uh indeed has a graph here of the projected freelance jobs this this was broken by covid so it I'm sure it went straight up beyond that but there is one thing right which I think people got the wrong message from it's that this book is about taking advantage exploiting the conversion rate between US dollar or any other foreign currency in India this is actually a financial book I'm not I'm a financial idiot but this is a book about Finance there's a book about how Global price Arbitrage works but we didn't know it back then we thought oh we're making money from US Canada etc etc that's why we getting paid so much we knew that we obviously Indians wouldn't pay us that much but a lot of people today are freelancing India to India which I think is a terrible idea like it's not it's not close to what you'd make freelancing outside do you have any thoughts on the financial angle of of what we wrote I think it was interesting because suddenly money which is a hard thing it's like like literally we were counting notes from the t-shirts no UPI back then yeah no UPI either to money becoming software like money becoming like something that comes in your email just like a attachment yeah that was like okay money is now you know it's in the computer and computer is kind of our domain like we're into this I don't know India to India is a bad thing it's just that if you're doing India to India it's not exactly freelancing you're running a business or you should be if you have one client you should do a job yeah pretty much right and I think the interesting thing about this is if money is virtual now and it's gotten even more virtual right with like whatever UPI crypto all of this stuff see the big picture right the whole point is you don't have to limit yourself geographically in terms of people opportunities that's also money yeah I think the and there's a line here where we said the best talent isn't local for the US guy there it's like to hire someone like a software engineer per year is like $200,000 but if you go to India it's like $20,000 so huge like it's an obvious win for them the problem is Trust of course they don't trust you know somebody who charging $20,000 because even they are like how can it be so low just like you are saying oh how can that pay be so high those guys are thinking oh how can the pay be so low especially during that period people just couldn't understand I had a easier time after some time charging more for my services than less MH it's weird because I was just like if I charge too less I the perception will be like scammer yeah you should just be slightly under what they were charging and that's when we were making awesome money right like when somebody else was charging X but we were like xus 20% they're like okay that's believable so I think that is where we really got the opportunity from just be slightly cheaper than you know what talent is already there like I feel like the clients they should see your profile and they should be like wow I can't believe this person exists yeah like price is one thing but it's like yo there's clearly something here like there's a mismatch yeah but I think we've ruined that I'll come to you know a little bit of where I feel like the world has changed to be become even more low trust now right because of certain people charging too little and then just being really bad at what they do and not communicating well like we have now have a bad reputation on the internet Indians like I I I wrote an article about this I don't know if you remember on medium I had written one article 2016 2017 about how there's too many Indians there charging too little and then scamming the customers right and because that you know now they they see that from you're from India and you get like a bad signal we'll come to that later but I think we also spoke about something called the pajama economy where we said that this is not true for all jobs might be true for design software Etc there's this V diagram what does this V diagram mean pajama and profit right uh first one is you got to be in the area of see we're doing this to make money right there needs to be a profit to it pajama it's about Comfort right in the sense that you don't have to work from pajamas but it's like you get to decide what level you want to be operating at right and so it's the it's the when diagram off it's sustainable it kind of grows number two it's in your control you can kind of um tune this up and down and in that intersection you can go deeper and figure out do you also feel like I mean one of the things I remember when we were talking about this is I also remember I said that it also has to be where the profit pool is like you can't fance certain things that there's no market for like you can't freelance as a grocery store worker right because you need to be there physically so this is this is a few jobs back then which were really overpriced in America knowledge work not overpriced maybe normal for them which we could really take advantage of that's where the profit pool the Arbitrage was and that's what you know we sort of um took advantage of and again we spoke about you know why they actually want to hire us because it's you know it's cheaper it's obvious uh there's one really cool thing you wrote about the economy here which I I loved right so I think before this I wrote some about of all this price parity and stuff but I think you wrote something very awesome which is you are free to take as much money you want from this River No Limits like the economy is like a river you you're free to take as much money as you want from this River No Limits the Only Rule is that you have to put in value that is equal to or more than the money you make it's very different from how regular people think about work today I'm going to a job you pay me I'll do the minimum yeah yeah okay but you're saying that it's like Indiana Jones you you've seen Indiana Jones most people haven't seen it right like uh if he's taking a treasure he has to put something of equal weight there otherwise the entire thing will collapse yeah so you have to it's a trade can you explain this better for us I think the kind of thing I was realizing back then was growing up we're more consumers of stuff right and so we're purely consuming the money though seemed to be in creating stuff right and so the whole point of value creation is yeah you're consuming stuff you're learning the skills but you need to create something out of it right so value creation is a huge part but then how does this tie to money so the economy as a flowing river like you're sitting in a cafe the lights are on people are making transactions all around you the economy is going right but if you want to be a part of this you can't just steal right you got to create something that has value people want it for that you know firstly people have to realize they want it and then if they do they pay you money for it and if you can just kind of figure out what's your part in this you can actually take as much money in the like flowing river of money you can take as much from it but then the way you do it is through value creation and I mean some people messaged me saying they loved this concept some people like bro what are you talking about but yeah I think once you run a business once you start getting into this it becomes a little obvious like yo I think if I push this much harder I'm going to get this much more more and so the question becomes what's my cap like can I just keep going yeah and I think it's not about hard work as much like it's it's not like that Crow and the water story where you just put keep putting like this thing and the water keeps rising and that that the stones are hard work the stones are value and sometimes value is not so connected to hard work it could be something that people really really really want but don't have but it's very easy for you to make it might take you one second to do it maybe you have an amazing talent to mimic somebody else's voice and let's say we were in an economy where that was very very valuable it'll take you 5 seconds for that 5 Seconds you make a lot of money like a like a celebrity doing a brand deal for a minute in that one minute they'll make more money than most people make in their lifetime but that's because there's a demand for it right so it's more demand that you satisfy with that value and you're able to take out out of the river right and when you run a business you're also delivering now value to your employees actually they are delivering value to you you are sending money to them so I see it as like a bunch of lines between all of us some lines are thicker because they're adding more value and therefore they taking extracting more and some lines are thinner because the value and the cash exchange is lower whereas the traditional employee mindset is I'll do school I'll do college I'll get this degree and then I'm going to get a job no matter even if I go to the office and do nothing which I think is a completely broken concept and it's made this should be the real concept thought right like social media has completely got like the inverse and it kind of sounds like some kind of business concept but in reality it's the most human thing ever like gratitude is Lindy right if can you explain what Lindy is it's something that has existed over time and continues to be today and so the longer something has stayed true the more it's probably a part of I'm probably not defining correctly but gratitude has been around forever right in a tribe if people are grateful to you because you provide something your value goes up and the the precursor to that is you got to figure out what value can I create that people want and money is just a codified version of it actually money started as an IOU like oh you did this for me thank you I owe you here's a slip you can use this next time next time you want I I grow buffalos you know you saved my life here I was almost about to die you come to my house you give me the slip I'll give you the Buffalo even if I'm not there my friend will give you the Buffalo he knows the slip that's literally what it is and when you go to work to a job you're supposed to deliver some value that is rare rarer the better right like if you have gold that time it was considered and the more grateful they are the more you can get the more it's valuable to them also like somebody's life is very valuable that's why medicine in the US super expensive right somebody's life is very valuable so the more valuable something is to somebody the more they they're willing to spend on it right so I wish more people understood this even today versus the oh I get a job and then all I have to do is like just you know 8 hours there or 7 hours I think that's like completely missing the point right I think it's it's more about value delivered next we spoke about and I love this right we spoke about pajama categories those V diagrams we said okay there's certain pools where there's profit M let's talk about the pools of the profit and we call these these pools the pajama categories these are the pools that we had seen on upwork and odesk I mean odesk at that time but dude there's a graph in this okay which I absolutely love it's truly played out I want to show people the graph yeah okay there's a there's a nice can you read out what are the categories so there's two axes one is demand for skills and the other one is time it starts with early adopter so there's very low demand for skills then there's acceptance that people are like okay this is something that's needed then this peak popularity where 2022 software engineering where everybody wants it and then suddenly there's commoditization which is now everybody can do it right therefore the value of the thing is going down commoditization basically means it's too easy to get this product so people are less grateful so they're spending less money on you and then there's this last thing called automation which in 2017 for some for us to have this graph uh was pretty cool so early adoption acceptance Peak popularity commoditization automation we have seen this with software right and I keep talking about it and I'm like yo Peak popularity was 2022 it's 2024 where on the other side of it starting to get commone pretty soon it's going to get automated right and we are seeing this exactly play out how do we have the wisdom to do this in 2017 I think it's connecting the pieces but question for you how does someone know where they are on the graph or is is is the industry on the graph or is an individual on the graph you can see by the number of courses being made on the topic right if there too many courses on it there's one it's fine there to that's fine feel like 100 people making courses on it you are Peak popularity and then once it gets to thousand people making courses on it you are commoditized right because then if thousand people are making courses on the demand for people learning it is very very high therefore when you're applying to a job as a software engineer now you're competing with so many others who have also learned the skill therefore you're less valuable to the employer Therefore your price is going down people like infosis TCS salaries have stayed static considering the inflation is continued to go up that actually means that the value of a software the average software engineer has declined which I believe in it's just Comm monetization if there were less software Engineers they were like software is still very valuable to the world don't get me wrong right people think I think software is over or whatever right like it's still very valuable to the world people are still going to use software whether internally or selling it outside that's a different debate but I feel like if you have so many software Engineers available for higher then the prices are going to go down it becomes a less rare product people are less grateful there's less of an IOU and then there's going to be automation bold of us to say this pre AI era but let's see if we've spoken any more about AI in a 2017 written book awesome so then we started speaking about pajama categories and dude we had like a bunch of categories here that we had some experience with I'm want to talk about them one by one the first one is admin support mhm and we said you can make between $3 to $10 an hour and the new technology Cycles every 1 to 3 years you have some experience with admin support yeah I think back then we thought admin support is like just low level hey you have to make an Excel sheet with 500 and just manually do da d da today for example there is somebody who runs operations on my team they get paid really well where they from they're from Philippines right um mother of two Unice does awesome work what's her name Unice okay and the thing is she's top performing employee right she's Pro she's also right now probably the only person in the team who's remote and it's not lowlevel task at all like it's firstly engaging with uh customers engaging with internal Community um talking to students talking to mentors but it's a high trust role like she has access to most of my stuff it's a high communication role like you can't just be like oh like you have to be very clear uh you have to constantly be in the loop with me and so admin support I did not expect it would be crazy I thought it would be lowlevel task and I think the lowlevel task I think she uses GPT for a lot of stuff but then it's also she's taken over a lot more responsibility because the small stuff she's just able to do it yeah awesome so dude there's one more thing you said in this some types of skills that fall under this pajama category include transcription yeah data entry personal and virtual assistantship customer service and research this is what your assistant does and you use a tool for this right you used a platform to get these assistants called some.com that time was called Shepherd or something right so in insane how admin support has become such a big thing that time it wasn't virtual assistants weren't that big I somewhere didn't exist back then or at least I hadn't heard of them which was awesome the next pajama category is marketing pretty obvious I think it's done fairly well you know everything from ad writing to you know video creation I think he's done superbly well would you put content under marketing we have a separate category called content writing it's the third category it's called content writing and we said time to learn the basics is 4 weeks client demand is high but we spoke about it in terms of writing this is pre Geo and I'll tell you what we've written okay this pajam category includes article and blog writing academic writing and research copywriting creative writing editing and proof reading web content and so on okay as a freelance content writer you have to understand the business and decide what content works best how to convey the message in the best way possible and how to drive a point that will affect the business goal okay and of course we spoke about content Management Systems like WordPress back then I think content is still very valuable I think both of these have combined now like marketing and content like a pure content writer probably not it you need somebody who thinks from that audience perspective I mean one thing I think we got wrong and maybe this was preo but I think we should have really accounted for video a lot more like people are not reading as much as they are watching people are watching like four five hours of video content a day yeah and to place this in time right we didn't have channels back then shorts didn't exist most podcasts were Audio Only blogs was the biggest category of content right because SEO was the primary way that you know we made our channels after the book The Publisher had asked us that we need to promote this who make channels I wouldn't have started my YouTube channel without this book The Publisher said go make a book so go make a channel so I thought screw it I'll do it I'm sure it's the same for you I think if we had written this book after we made the channel we would have been like yo we experimented this there's some traction here maybe it's going to become big but insane content writing then there was design which I think you've captured as a category in India uh this includes user experience design web design illustration logo design branding why has it become all about uiux today yeah why is the narrative captured by that I think uh uiu caught like this was mid last decade a lot of web designers were like yo are we only going to do websites like what's next and the fact that mobile was picking up apps were picking up the biggest apps we used today you know started last decade um I think design uiu design became one of the highest valued design roles mostly because the output you created would be used by millions of people right much rarer for yeah much rarer for design to be scalable although today I kind of feel like it's gone to a point where as a designer you cannot just do uiux you got to be thinking about the bigger picture and so so I do feel it's shifting towards a More Design generalist role but you know the way I will probably rephrase this is people care about experiences right Cold Play tickets um you know concerts in India going crazy cafes more cafes than ever people want you know not just the cafe branding logo to be great they want the physical experience to be great they want the merch experience they want to put this on Instagram they want the virtual experience to be great a lot of d2c companies yeah yeah so I think the design we're we're probably I feel like we're early in design in the sense that design now is becoming a bit of an all-encompassing thing where it's all experience whether that all experience all touch points UI X which is web app in-person experience merch experience physical product experience content and media experience and so brand experience as a category yeah I think that's a new one that I see I would call it graphic design but I've also realized that that's like calling a coder computer typist right so I think design needs a rebirth like a design needs a branding rebirth in a way right because I feel like there's lots of valuable task but kids don't want to do it like I'm having a hard time convincing people that look UI is good but how many app screens will you do once the company becomes successful it doesn't need any more those companies are flooded with designers and we don't really use new apps anymore I haven't downloaded a new app in like forever right so uh that era is over now everything's moved on inside the apps the arena is now inside YouTube inside Instagram posts videos Etc so people have just missed out on this whereas apps also technically were inside a layer which is the app stores which is inside the phones so it's just gone one layer deeper it's not it's and it's not any less valuable or more valuable it's just as a YouTube channel for YouTube or an Instagram channel for an account the content you post there that you know back in the day to get crazy amount of users you needed to make the app now within the app each account has millions of monthly actives millions of daily actives right so the attention of detail that you would give to that now it's everything I have I I have one very important three four paragraphs that we've written okay for example if you're working in uiux design we would highly recommend sketch app of figma yeah this is 2017 figma if you were saying that it released in 2016 yeah it came out of closed beta in 2016 that's insane so a year into figma you said this is going to be the next big thing and then it's been now it's like popular maybe last year it was like at Peak popularity right um that's insane that's like I mean but but that's the thing right like now it's coming into design school curriculums figma at that time nobody knew it they were still teaching Photoshop and little bit of other tools and whatnot right Coral draw and all that now figma has become Main stream it's the same thing like people don't recognize that actually we will always be far before your school curriculums like we're using stable Fusion now it's been it's been a year actually we started using stable Fusion the day it came out we started using chgb we've gotten faster your cols have gotten slower 5 years later stable diffusion will be in your CV and you'll be like in your in your college course and you'll be like oh I remember these guys talking about it by that time it'll be like 35 37 something like that and and that's the early adopter curve right yeah if you like you most people will only hear about it when it hits Peak popularity but you have to be in the niche you have to be a nerd about something to even catch these little waves we said more stuff for Logos and animations Vector design tools like Adobe illustr Illustrator and Affinity Designer work well for video production and animation Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premier Pro are widely used and that's now your category with a yeah yeah so I think really um it's been 7 eight years six seven whatever lots of years and it's incredible that many of the technology predictions have held up like you should have assumed in six seven years new things would have come out lots of people are building new video editing tools not lots of people are building new design apps yeah uh or apps to do design yet the status quo has held up Photoshop is still King figma is still doing well considering it was back then why do you why do you think the tooling hasn't changed so much I think the tooling has it's just that when it comes to Peak popularity when it comes to the mainstream teams will use whatever is most popular like it's hard for you to convince your um 100 person org back then even back then um when I was at unacademy we were using sketch and then one day I was like guys we need to switch to figma and they were an early stage startup they were like yeah whatever you say goes but I knew counterparts who were like yo we pay a lot of money to Adobe for our licenses and Adobe XD is bundled into this and so we can't switch and so it became a company top down decision because it was the peak popularity thing there's one line I said here which is there are huge overlaps in what you can create with these tools UI and video I mean design and video sister I mean it's almost the same thing right one is motion design one is design motion why why have students taken it to feel like like completely separate categories like in my books a UI designer should be able to do video and vice versa like it doesn't feel but I know the comments will say otherwise I know there are different things but both have behavioral elements to them you can't when you do video editing it's not like a brain dead going and saying I'll just make this animation you're thinking about the end guy right you're thinking about how to keep his retention up with UI you're thinking about the flow and the convenience of that flow but people tend to pitch these as two completely separate Fields why I think it's because in the past decade skills took very long to learn like Photoshop I took a year or two before I got comfortable right and so if skills take really long to learn you learn less skills per unit time and so the mediums that you're in are very limited versus now with figma somebody can learn figma within a couple of hours within a week you feel quite comfortable and so if your skill has gotten better you are probably now want to explore more with it and the thing you said absolutely right which is actually thinking in terms of my capabilities skills mediums is the old way of doing it the new way of doing it is what do people want users right in the end a user is going to interact on their phone with your app your video anything you put out and then also the environment in you know your cafe or your physical products and so you got to think in terms of what do users want what's their experience and also what do Brands want to make that bridge to close that gap between where you know where they are and what users want I don't like that that's a very College way of doing things electrical engineering is different from this engineering from that it's a very Branch driven which I don't like the next thing we spoke about was webdev which is I think we agree that it's done fairly well in the last 6 seven years we spoke about Game Dev 3D modeling a lot of freelance opportunities from the US even right now like companies like the Mill who outsourced to 3D um modelers in India I met one who's doing superbly well 30 40 lakhs ANM because of the price parity it's not great salary for there but here it's an awesome salary um so I think that's good we also gave a bunch of courses like all free courses where how you can learn Unity we spoke about Unity web dev uh sorry Unity Video Game Dev uh we spoke about 3D game programming this is back in 17 right and if you remember back then I think I was pushing back like let's not include the courses right because I was like anybody who wants to do this needs to build theit of figuring it out themselves but then the other balancing side that you brought in was like you need to give people a starting point right um figuring it out is hard yeah gets even harder when you're in there's so much noise right there's so many people selling and you don't know what is like that's why we kept it all this stuff free just like yo this is free stuff you get started with this at least then you have some direction to choose the path like without going through through the tutorial if you have to choose a path in any game you don't know where to go it's confusing yeah next we spoke about product management my personal opinion is I think we were wrong about this I don't think PM is a freelance job yeah I think pm today is a very people Centric role you need to be there yeah and yes if you're remote there's a big gap in fact I feel like admin support that's probably the wrong word for it because this person she's now my not even virtual assistant executive assistant head of operations almost I would say the similarity not to say that they're the same similarity is that product management people intensive very trust-based role High communication skill and uh hard to do online yeah yeah but doable but it didn't I don't think it picked up in the way picked up it got popular but I just feel like it's one of those roles where if you're really good at it you should be in the office like You' be much better at it in the office because it's so directly connected to business objectives like all the other things are not everything else we spoke about as freelancing the reason you can freelance it is not directly connected to business objectives even code is not like you don't know how many how much more sales you're doing because of some line of code you can't quantify that and I feel like because of that you can always Outsource it because you're like it's not like it's critical but it's not something where you know me having one person outside is going to damage but PM like decisions on what to build will you lose a lot of time if you have the wrong person doing it and you need it to be directly under the f ERS or whoever the guy running the bus guy or girl running the business is product management commoditized today or is it are we already at a part where it's automated I think it's not even hit Peak popularity yeah I think product management is still a little bit early uh it's like acceptance people know it's important people think it's a wo woo role right like people think oh why do you need product management lot young people think that uh older people over uh like process it right they're like no you do a and then B and then C that's how you do product management I think it's not about any of that I think it's about uniquely understanding what your users want it's a behavioral role actually a lot of this to become successful is like understanding Behavior right like so as a PM if you know users are always going to do this like in a video we know that you know if if you you know we have a part where it gets too long and we're dragging it on to give more context we can go deeper if necessary but sometimes we don't because we're like bro they will click off and the video will do 10 times worse just because you've gone slightly deeper on this one point especially in short form so you know it's not really like it's just understanding Behavior it's the same with apps right like you know if you have three buttons what's the darkest pattern to have to people to keep people there it's a little bit of dark arts you know going on there but it's it's a behavioral role and you need to sit with the data so little hard to do remote then we spoke about app and backend Dev uh and we gave them like the full thing right full vamy we spoke about hey you start with learning databases which is SQL anything based on SQL then we spoke about you need a language so for example c c Ruby Java we were using a lot of Ruby on Rails back then so the third thing we spoke about was you know framework like you know Ruby on Rails Java has spring stuff like that so I feel we gave them a very good uh you know starting point and this was also one of the highest paid remote roles this is where I was making the most money like I did some design but I didn't make as much money doing design as I did Ruby on Rails I think that made me quite a bit of money um and the the revolution of Ron real has just made everything simpler right it came with something that we called scaffolding which means that you want some you know a specific type of create read update destroy type of page where maybe a you know Forum post or whatever you can just generate that quickly like a starting point very quickly and Ruby had a great Community where people used to put out these things called gems where they said you can use a gem and you can figure out authentication you can do this automatically you can do this automatically so the community was awesome so you didn't you weren't like really you know gizy code right you were like bro my job is to give this feature to the customer I'm paid per the by the hour so I want to do more for the customer and one thing that started happening after I started using ruon rails I'm sure it happened to you as well once you got good at the skill you started pricing differently we stopped pricing per hour well like we're getting good at this we can do this authentication thing we've done it 50 times it doesn't make sense that I get paid per the hour for doing this anymore I'll charge fixed price for these five features that's when we start thinking more like a company rather than than an hourly basis thing and I want to touch on that a little bit later but we spoke a lot about how do I pick and we also spoke about how a lot of success in many of these jobs including writing code is creativity and there's this beautiful image that that I made right like I don't know if you can see this right yeah it's about how how to become creative it's actually you can anyone can become creative it is first step copy something Second Step understand how it was made okay third step break it down into its individual components what is part A what is Part B what is part C Etc learn how individual components were made so you learn each unit each token of the thing and then finally put individual components together in a new way and that putting individual components in a new way uses creativity so you break things down into their individual tokens or their individual units put them together in a new way and that's called creativity 2017 you said creativity is not like some crazy you know you're right born with it or not it's learnable if you replace the words creativity the word creativity here with Gen it's exactly the same thing this is exactly how gen is creative you take something you break it down into its individual tokens you put it back together in new ways it's roughly how gen works today so that's why gen is creative yeah yeah and I think the thing people miss out on is if they combine things together in the most standard Normy basic way you're going to end up with an output that is words or maybe the same as gen if you want to really get creative above the base creativity of where Tech is today you got to have good taste where does good taste comes from it comes from your experiences in life how you internalize these experiences and then want to really Express that in your work right the best designers I've worked with they go crazy when they find a rare resource when they find a small way they can improve their thing better or they're like wo I I can't even believe why didn't I think of that right versus most people who maybe are self-limiting they're saying I'm not a creative person those people are really blocking themselves because they're not even taking the effort of going and finding what's out there yeah like one thing I've I was very sure of is that creativ you can make people creative like I've seen people who are completely uncreative who work with us for a while and then actually become creative it's just about learning the patterns in your industry like I would be very uncreative in real estate because I don't know enough about the industry but once you know an industry well you can break it down into units you can rearrange those units you can bring something new to it there's one more piece we wrote in this chapter and we're about halfway through the book right now but it's an important piece about passion versus money and there's one line we said which is that the only thing that really works is discipline do you agree with this I think discipline works great in the short term to keep you going but if you really want to stick through something in the long term passion is super important yeah that's one thing I've changed my mind on like I used to think it's all about discipline and just doing the same thing over and over now that it's been 10 years since I started more than 10 12 years since I started my career technically bro it's it's everything is Passion driven like you can't sustain any career without passion like 10 years is a long time to be disciplined no human has the discipline to do it 10 years you either love it or you don't and if you don't love it you're going to burn out in 2 years if you love it or you find a way to love it you can stay for 10 years and looking back it's not that I I don't think I was the most disciplined person neither was I it's just that I couldn't imagine doing anything else and uh I was like it's this or nothing and so I didn't even stop to think and once you keep going down that uh you reach these places where people haven't even can I ask you why we why we thought it was about discipline we were very young we were like 23 24 we had some experience we were running companies I was running a company you were at head of design at on Academy why did we think it was about discipline I think the word passion carries a negative thing where it's like oh movies are my passion music is my passion like people abuse the word passion yeah but if you kind of let's just say remove the current associations with the word passion and you're like it's the thing that you can't imagine yourself not doing yeah suddenly there's very few of those things in your life it's so surprising that both of us agree that passion is super important where 6 seven years ago we wouldn't have agreed I we would have just been like bro passion like stupid I think in college people misuse the word passion you're right but actually it's all passion all the way down like if you're really passionate about something and you've shown signs of being passionate about it you are going to do well at some point or the other yeah it's you will Outlast every other person who's there just for money yeah and I don't think one cool thing about both of us is I don't think we've ever done anything for the money we've always even the passion leads you to a point where you know there zero money in it you'll still go there I know you very well and you know me very well so we'll always go there yeah interesting next chapter is around communicating your value and I think we spoke about how to charge right we said that when you start your career you start you know at an early rate and over time you move to fixed price because uh but it's bad to start with fixed price in the starting because you don't know how to bill um and we also spoke about weekly billing you have any thoughts on this I think the core concept is if you think you're really good why doesn't the world believe so right if you're really so smart why can't you put in that effort or figure out how to make the world believe that and I think the problem is people don't know how to communicate their value which is how do you make the skills you have relevant to the other person got it so you know what I feel is that um I think this chapter doesn't matter I think if you're good you can charge whatever you want if you're bad you will always be like even if you say I want hourly billing monthly billing weekly billing I want this much client will be like get out of there it's it's like it's this right who wants the other person more and I feel like a lot of freelancing is converting it from a push based business where you're trying to get leads to a pull based business we'll come to that I think that applies to everything now uh but before that we spoke about how to get clients and I think this is the important part let's assume somebody already has the skills or started picking up the skills we spoke about how to get clients and that time it was different compared to today so we have a chapter there called the platform game we said how do you land your first project use these vertical platforms like upwork right that time it was called odesk how do use uh you know dribble behance there bunch of platforms right and you was you had this amazing piece about your player profile how it's about creating a profile that people are really attracted to you think we were right about the platform game I think now decades later um we live in a matrix all right like straight up all right and I think the reality of it is you have to realize you are playing a game cuz if you don't realize you're playing a game you don't realize that hey I don't have to play to not lose I can play to win but for that I need to understand what game am I playing I feel like this platform game one thing we were wrong about is I don't think it was about as much about up workor and this thing and that I mean social discoverability was very low back then not enough people had Internet it's just how does an American client find you the guy who desperately has the problem how do you get in front of him the day he has the problem and I feel like using platforms was the only way because that's like urgency right leaking into the world but I feel like today it's become about Twitter and Instagram and YouTube today it's like earlier we were selling in these Niche markets whoever really wanted the service today you're going out on Twitter and ringing the bell and like you have to do that so the platforms have evolved into like these super platforms right the twitters and the the things of the world and I think one cool thing you said is that when you're reaching out to somebody communication is key and we spoke about what it looks like from the Freelancers perspective and what it looks like from the client's perspective let's say you pick up a project you are saying okay day one I'm doing the cool design day two I'm like you know doing something else day three you know I'm fixing this from the client's perspective day one I just paid the guy I haven't heard anything day two I haven't heard anything day three is 100% scamming me so you spoke about how it doesn't matter how much work you do that's important but you also have to communicate your value yeah I mean not value you have to communicate what you're up to yo I finished this today here's the temporary screen you have finished this today like even today I work with so many people outside of the business and even in the business who won't even respond and I assume it's dead two weeks later they'll respond and they'll be like bro I finish this right and it'll be completely wrong direction from what I wanted right or it'll be perfect either way I lost trust even if two weeks you come back and you don't respond to me and you do something good I will still have lost trust in you cuz I'm like I can't trust you through the process today you might have done this right next time when we do a project we might have gone in a completely different direction or whatever we're doing so the line in bold here is managing expectations and consistent communication I think everyone who's read this book learned the skills part and we have a huge audience that now has the skills but they forgot managing expectations in consistent communication why it's the harder thing yeah in fact a note on this back when I started freelancing I assumed the client knows best right because I still little bit carried that um employer employee like you have to seek Authority and so I assumed the client knows best which led to an assumption that the client will tell the process but in reality like looking at today today when I send a proposal I'm like hey every 48 Hours you will on the dot receive an update from me the first update will be within on this date every week we will have these many calls and you know I I set the process I set the frame are so busy yeah and the client feels awesome about this because they don't have to now think about it and live in this uncertainty they know that this person has a system they have a process and that I know at every stage where we are what the expectation was and where we're going to go next would you recommend people use platforms today like Odes upwork I mean upwork and all the others I think a platforms are a great way to get leads but the problem is the platform set this path and process for you which means they also charge extra for it but then it also means you get a lot of people competing to be in this it's a little hard today with the competition today yeah so my suggestion would be if you're able to create your own platform which could be on any of it could be a Twitter it could be a YouTube it could be your personal website that you're driving traffic chapter about that we'll come to that I think that's the better approach and honestly if you are on these platforms and you're trying to stand out having an external source that the client can actually go and look you up massive Advantage you know one thing we spoke about is that it's good for your first client platforms but after that it's about repeat projects and referals you want your first client to connect you to because clients are usually well connected like if you're an entrepreneur and you're successful you'll know other entrepreneurs part of the game I feel like so many people forget this and their customers over like they don't respond to their clients they do a shitty job they get thrown out of projects and they go get a new one you don't want to be in a place where you're constantly getting new projects but you're constantly losing old projects because what you'll realize if you do a great job for that first customer that's five new customers guaranteed guaranteed or at least two new customers guaranteed just do the best job you can don't be in expansion mode before you you're in the you know I've proven this mode and I feel like too many people want to make too much money really quick and one learning I've had is it takes time I'm sure you also had this right like it takes 6 seven years for things to even if you start freelancing you'll be successful in year three year four we start 2012 when we first started freelancing 2015 is when we started making serious money and that not very consistently today I'd probably be able to make very consistent freelance money if if I were to do it but I still feel like it took so long right to be to be in the top few and top few is where the money is and the rarest thing is trust right the people who are burning each and every client they just assume they can just get the next one yeah but that might seem like a good shortterm strategy but over the long term you make it so much easier for yourself if you are able to roll this trust across clients why why do they do it why do they burn clients especially when freelancing online people are like my clients don't know each other so if I do something here other next client is not going to know right versus in real life everyone knows each other everybody knows each other if you don't deliver if you someone over it's straight up that word gets around and I think trust takes a while again you can lose it but then reputation is how is as trust builds up that becomes this thing called reputation I don't think you can onot build reputation but small steps trust becomes reputation dude we did a project okay where for one of our clients where there was another agency involved and the agency guy got thrown out of the project okay and he's like first day he got the project he's like can I tweet about this he'll get us some more this thing or whatever I was like I don't know ask the client because there's a separate agency young kid okay I was like I don't even know why he was on the project and he was like I want to tweet about this I'm like listen when you're online what you doing online and what you're doing offline is like when you're not the same person online offline the world gets to know eventually so it's best to be the same person online offline and that might take you some time I understand when you're 20 you can't be that cuz you have nothing and you're hustling and you're trying and you're struggling and everyone's story Little online little bit is exaggerated 20% people can give you but it can't be like 2,000% different yeah right so you have to I think that's very important and we also spoke about Community right like being in a community of other Freelancers and uh people next next we spoke about the Freelancers mindset which is how much money can you make you know what's the target etc etc which I think is kind of a boring chapter cuz I think and I think the main takeaway from this chapter is I mean it's just about how much money you can make I think we were right about all the numbers but I think the main thing here we call it is the we we came up with this is the first project effect nobody believes they can freelance till they get a project online and they deliver and I feel like today the first project effect a lot of people have gone through that time it was just two of us and maybe two three others in our in our circle like SES karik bunch of others but anyone outside of that didn't believe us like it's like they look at you with disbelief they're like no you're not making money online the only way is through a job I had a friend I don't know if you were there I had a friend who was sitting next to me on a table and he was like bro I'll do anything for a five lak perom job right I don't I think you know who I'm talking about this is in college I like yo we're making so much more than that and then we'd say it and they be like it's like no we're making it and they're still like look at you and they be like no chance so that's uh today that believability element is there everyone believes you can make money freelancing which is which I think is cool I think first project effect underrated because if you you need to First prove to yourself that you can do it that's the first project effect you need to prove to yourself a second time that you can do it so you know it wasn't a fluke you need to prove it to yourself the third time that you can do it so you're like now I feel confident convincing the world that yes yes that's that's me but to be honest you'll never feel 100% confident even if you're doing 100 projects you have a big company you have hundreds of employees I feel like you still won't be fully confident like that fear is always going to be that can I repeat this or am I just a one trick pony yeah that's there in everybody's head awesome next chapter and this is a chapter that a lot of people disagreed with us on back then but I think now it's become real it's called your personal brand dude 2018 2017 we wrote the book 2018 it was published nobody believed in the ideas of of a personal brand they said well you mean CV and I was like I remember this conversation I used to have with people like no no I don't mean CV I mean personal brand they're like CV LinkedIn I was like no bro that is like your work history or college history whatever I talking about your personal brand I'm talking about you putting yourself out there putting out content about yourself you telling the world what you can do like you mean sales and people didn't get it like they didn't understand why everybody needs to build a personal brand the VCS were like Founders shouldn't build a personal brand it should be about company and I was like people don't listen to companies people listen to people and they're like no no no it has to be the company building a brand I don't want the founders to build a brand and at the same time you know employers didn't want their employees building a brand they're like bro you work for me stop building brand stop doing you know putting out your own content on the site today it's been normalized in every company everyone's putting out content on the site and that's completely fine and I think you know we said there are two things right to build a person brand one is be better than the average person at your skill and number two share what you know and teach others that's what we've done for 10 years what why did we get this right and other people get this wrong I think people have this apprehension about being a too salesy like promo guy promo guy they're like I don't want to be seen as desperate right and back in the day to give you an idea if if you were somebody let's say you were in school and you started a YouTube channel your friends would laugh at you the next day you come to class they going to be like look at this guy look at this guy what are you doing today it's like yo I mean firstly everybody's got a channel whether that's on Tik Tok Instagram or YouTube but they don't even think about it right so today's generation the question is not about should I build a personal brand or what is personal brand it's more about how can I put myself authentically out there such that people resonate with it they're attracted to me and they get to know what I'm all about back then it was like yo I mean why should I put myself on the internet that's so risky what if people think something of me right versus today yeah that's the default I feel it came from our freelancing this thing we were competing against on odesk I once did this math right I was like any given point of time any project will like 50 applications how do I look better than the other 50 applications I was like whatever I say I'll do it with jazz we'll do a nice CV around it we'll do like if I'm putting my you know work experience I'll do it nicer I'll make a nice Banner was that sort of stuff I was just trying to win the deal against the other 50 today you're on that big platform Twitter Instagram the competition is now tens of thousands of people now you absolutely need to be more salesy yeah right and I feel over time it's become more about you have to promote yourself otherwise no one's going to give two shits and we also were right that it has to be built personally and not at a company level nobody cares about company brands even if you have a company brand and you have a face on it the face will get popularity yeah and the company's loyalty at the end of the day will be to the face we've learned this with all the edex now right where they'll build like some superhero and then when those superheroes leave the tech get kind of gets crushed on the way out like I I think we just took what was true for freelancing and we were telling the world the Freelancers to build a personal brand today everyone has some freelancer Dynamic so everyone's built a personal brand I think the misconception people had was personal brand is I have a logo I have a logo and that's my profile picture and now I'm a personal brand yeah but I think the thing that we realized to break this down is you got to put in the work you got to put in the right amount of actions this lead to some results show that you show it as people see these results they're like oh we can trust this person as your trust builds up people are like oh they can do this thing and now they have a reputation for it yeah and then as your reputation builds up all of these things together that's your personal brand interesting and you know we we also spoke about promoting your content not just putting out the content where do you promote it and we said Hacker News Reddit Kora Facebook Facebook groups Twitter yeah only Twitter survived and it's not even called Twitter you know what did we get wrong about promoting your content we didn't we didn't account for video here I think that's our big Miss like ntin Kut put out a post about how they really missed the early train of YouTube and now they want to go all in and they're spending you know you know a lot of money and they're getting a lot of talent to do video I feel like we didn't see video coming I mean we saw it we spoke about Premier Pro and this thing we just didn't see how big it would become and how much of people's time they' consume on more video I think it was weird back then to watch video on your phone because I never watched an influencer till like 2021 I was like you're following influencers and phones were smaller they were slow and so if you want to watch a video inter was terrible on phones yeah so if you want to watch a video you will watch it on your computer yeah and even that you're not going to stream it it'll probably be you know you're watching it video took over it was insane so we we put a recap on how to build a personal brand work on enough projects and gain references to be notable in your field create a personal website WordPress or a medium blog now I would add YouTube uh post original content that you've written on a regular basis pick a regular schedule stick to it whether it's daily weekly monthly build a recurring Audience by creating a newsletter and sending out emails with your content I feel like that's changed now to just video content once you have more inbound projects coming in than outbound which at some point there's some scale I think the scale is about 100,000 followers at which point you'll get more inbound than outbound maybe sooner if you're in a niche yeah for you it would have been 20 25,000 000 right where inbound is higher than outbound then you can win off freelancing platforms then you don't need to look right and I think the next chapter was something I was completely wrong about which is the art of the cold email we still thinking about outbound back then and this entire chapter right about cold emailing customers finding their details reaching out to them crap like I feel like this is the one thing we were wrong about why I have thoughts but I want to hear your thoughts whether you think we were wrong I think when you starting out it's very tempting to just Spam the world get get your this thing out there me me me me me say something say something and follow up 20 times and get blocked yeah versus when eventually you have this trust and reputation you just have to say hey I like your work interested in working together let's get on a call and if you have this base of work built up if you have this reputation buil up people reply and so I think uh the other thing in this is that today most cold emails are Chad GPT and it's obvious Chad GPT so I see it and I'm like yo this sucks versus back then even to write a base cold email you had to do it yourself uh today though saturated and it's very hard to cold made without a portfolio like without some body of work why should I trust you you're emailing me why should I work with you give a reason like especially somebody who's successful they'll always ask why should I work with you give a reason and if you haven't built anything by yourself there's no reason for you to give and you're wasting their time and they've got a lot of people wasting their time in their email so I feel like the saturation got really high and these people want to work with good people what I realized is the smartest people in the world actually want to work with good people so they if you have a portfolio and you done work they will reach out to you you don't need to do anything it is just a complete waste of time in my opinion to send cold emails today it is much maybe there's some this thing in Twitter DMS or LinkedIn DMS or whatever but I feel like even then you need a personal cuz they will look at your profile when you DM somebody first thing they're going to do if they don't know you is they're going to click on you and they're going to find out what has this person done so anyway the personal brand matters more because they're deciding at the DM level should I even respond to this person is it even worth my time and interesting people are always looking to connect with other interesting people yeah it's it's it's like it is what it is so I feel like the the previous chapter kind of negated this chapter and I feel like if we had to do it again we'd just be like just focus on the personal brand instead and then at some point you will get to a scale where your DM matters and then it's no longer spamming or sending 10 emails or whatever like I was desperate when I was 20 we needed clients so we did some of this but I wouldn't do it again and I have some people who follow up so many times that I'm just like bro stupid right then we spoke about there's an entire chap about tax tax was a very new thing back then yeah I mean this has changed a lot because the tax rules in India have changed there's no way we could predict this we're both not financially Savvy uh but uh I I feel like just get a person like I don't think do do you bother with your tax do you personally see your tax got somebody who does it yeah like I don't even know how much money I've made to be very honest like I just have a person doing it and I trust them and I've been working with them for a while if I get in trouble I get in trouble um then we spoke about managing your finances where we spoke about where to save all this I think that's been like we had some rules okay which is number one avoid debt I think that's correct but I also feel like you don't want to get logged into loans and em yeah but also I've seen the other side when you have a loan you actually work harder once you have enough money a loan makes you work even harder otherwise it's very easy to retire on less money next thing is talk about money I disagree with this I don't think you should talk about money I think the only place you can talk about money is high trust circles yeah you should not talk about publicly the minute you do it in a public domain it triggers people yeah and I I've decided in my life I don't want my life to be about money at all like it has to be about cool experiments things I'm doing  money uh the minute you talk about money people make it only about money and then you lose your identity as anything ex else except money hate it then diversify that I still agree with and the last one is habituate to a Frugal lifestyle I think disagree yeah yeah your Balenciaga shoes are very expensive how much they cost 80k yeah so why why have we uh why have we see my guess is when you're starting out you're playing in defensive right you don't want anything to go wrong and so you're always protecting what you have which is great it's good to have that mindset so from that perspective I understand you got to be a little paranoid at 20 we didn't have that much money at 23 we didn't have that much money so this was important yeah but moving forward as you grow older you want novelty in life you want to connect with people over interesting things that you've got going on and in general I think you know like street wear in India huge right now why it's because people want to express themselves right so it's not about being Frugal and wearing Basics it's about it's not about money it's like I want to express myself through whatever I buy through the products through what I watch yeah we kept saying that the lower your personal burn burn rate the more money you can put into learning through new things and trying out new ideas that's what I do every dollar we make we put it back and trying something new cuz I don't know what else to do with life to be very honest I think what this can be really bad advice because for me I delayed hiring a team for the first 2 years of running 10K designers I tried to do everything by myself and I think a little bit of it was the whole Silicon Valley thing of don't hire before you need to and of course being Frugal being paranoid I don't want the company to die but then eventually I realized you can't just hold money like this right you got to you got to have a hand open if you want to receive dude it's like this I sometimes I so the first time I played GTA right uh one of the recent versions I would like buy buy something and then I'd buy more things but I wouldn't use it like I play a lot of souls games right like elen ring Wukong I'll have items I just won't use it because I'm like if I use it it'll go and the worst feeling bro you finish the game and you're like why would I have so many items oh my God right so and even though I play a new game and I'm like now I use all the items I collected and you can do a new game plus right where you play the second version of the same I mean second retelling of the same this thing and I still don't use items I'm like but if I use it it'll go and maybe there's a chance I'll die maybe there's a chance I'll lose so yeah it is like I still believe in spending everything back on the company like I feel like playing a life where you hold money is not really a fun life and you're taking away from the economy that's money that if other people are giving you value you should put it back and that's why we tend to hire people and and whatnot um it's a it's a more fun life like now that you're working with the team compared to when you doing it with two three people it's so much more fun yeah I don't need discipline just like every single day I'm excited about every small thing that happens exactly yeah next is a chapter on managing stress and ambiguity and uh again we spoke about creativity the minute you becomes about creative flow when you copy something understand how it is make made break it down blah blah blah creativity really helps the opposite of creativity when you're stuck doing something is called anxiety where you're using creativity in the wrong way basically you're creative about bad incidents that might happen in the future I have learned one or two things about you know managing stress and ambiguity in freelancing and running a company and work in general but I want to hear your thoughts first yeah I think the opposite of creativity is like creativity is all about flow but the opposite of that is resistance and I think when you are stressed when you're anxious you start resisting things because you're like I want to be safe from this but the more you resist the less you can get into flow um yeah I feel like um I feel like people make bigger demons in their head than than it is the first time I raised funding for us 1.72 cror is a big amount of money but if I had hung out with other entrepreneurs I would know that it's not a big amount of money even for back then it was okay it was decent but it was not that big and lots of investors that pulled it in so but in my head I thought I raise like 100 million and the the anxiety and pressure on me was very high and I broke down because of it to be honest like the first two years like I don't recommend anyone being an entrepreneur right out of college it's a little bit hard like you can't absorb the pressure yet and Entrepreneurship is more pressure absorption role than it is anything else cuz every day there's some right and can you can you manage it so I feel like a lot of managing stress and anxiety is not making it a big demon in your head like even work you can just quit you hate a job why stay you can just quit it's normal I feel like when you're working from home though you make bigger demons in your head or if you don't have peers so if you sit in an office and you have 10 peers who are all like when I was giving exams right like we were in manipal you know we' all sit in one house and we'd be like bro I don't know anything about tomorrow I haven't studied and there'll be 10 other guys who like yeah even I didn't study and all of us would High fire and then we'd all go and almost fail right somehow we' come out uh but I feel like if I was sitting at home doing the exams would have been much bigger pressure in my head I wouldn't know what the normal this thing is so when you do a job if there are 10 other people if you do freelancing freelancing with 10 other people are like bro this is normal this ambiguity about next month is normal then you feel more calmed because you misery loves company and when you have five other people who are in the same state as you you feel better so I feel like a lot of this anxiety can be erased by just sitting with five other people who do the same thing as you in some Community or some this thing that's why companies are much better than freelancing cuz you're doing it like you're doing it with 10 people now they're all feeling similar things and that helps you deal sleep a little bit better and I think the world realized how important communities were when we were forced to be alone during pic yeah we went mad yeah and yes there was a lot of Discord activity and you're doing all of this but overall the bigger picture it points at is if you're doing something alone just by yourself you feel like the odd one out and so you kind of create this massive resistance in your head like what if it goes wrong what if I do this versus the minute you do it in a community it's like hey it's not your problems are not unique problems are not unique and everything is figureoutable like you can do it you can figure it out yeah um yeah I agree I think I have some thoughts around work from home which we'll come to right around pajama Prophet itself yeah but we'll talk about that later then the penultimate chapter which I think this is the last chapter we'll cover it's called robots will take your job yeah 2017 bold statement to make there's no reason and no way a human mind can keep up with an artificial intelligence Machine by 2035 gray Scott I think most people probably skipped this chapter number one because it was the last one so they're like oh whatever um um but I don't think people took it seriously yeah I mean I don't think I took it seriously when you suggested we add this as a chapter yeah but it was obvious not it's some point or the other like it might not have been AI based automation it could have been other ways but we spoke about AI specifically here but it's this curve AB enough right this curve that eventually after commoditization automation comes and automation could come in many ways automation couldn't come with somebody else giving you an SDK of your entire app and then you can just Implement that instead of building your entire app like we saw that happen in my previous company right so I mean you can think about this in this like 10 years 20 years ago to maintain a an e-commerce store would cost you $200,000 you need engineer you need Magento today it's like Shopify at $2 $30 a month yeah right so that is Automation in a way right like now you don't need an entire e-commerce store there's already something that provides it for you as the End customer and you as the End customer don't care whether it's yours and you know you have a Dev running it on Magento that's actually more complexity compared to Shopify which you know is a billion dollar Stable Company where lots of other people will complain if it goes down like you want reliability and stability once you get to a certain scale and we it has now been proven that Shopify is reliable at scale but back then people were still unclear they're like there was used to be this argument that it's better to do Magento with your own Dev than Shopify and we had a lot of clients also reaching out saying I want to do my own store with Magento or whatever so that was what I meant when I meant automation to some extent right which is somebody will build something and then you the thing that you would build for a customer now is replaced lowlevel repeating tasks eventually people eventually there's a lot of incentive to like hey let's just get this out of the way yeah yeah and then there I said there were chat Bots that are replacing aspects of customer support so that's turned out to be true um and then we also spoke about should I be scared right about this Automation and we said that look you don't want too many people jobless it turns to verbal and physical violence and that's what we're seeing on Twitter we're seeing a lot of verbal violence play out because people have a lot of free time in their hands and people should not have that much free time um humans have a mind that invents problems real or fictional right and then we spoke about how the pajama Prof economy actually helps when you're freelancing at least you have something to do you have some gigs to keep doing and it's different from where you do lots of odd jobs versus you know you're doing one repeatable automatable thing where you're using this creativity but dude there's a bunch of lines here where I'm just going to read it out the defense against this is when each human being can create one unique combination of experiences and skills based on their personal interests and purpose they can build their own unique brand Brand Story an AI can't copy a unique Brand Story an AI can't write a book about it can write a book about Superman but it can never make money because it's copyright to someone else yeah the chapter creating your personal brand in this book reflects the idea this is the only way humans can differentiate between themselves and a trainable machine the trainable machine has no heart no passion both true and no creativity and then in brackets I said machines will get pretty creative soon though you can read it here right so we were right I mean it's a complete disagreement a lot of people thought at that point machines are not going to be creative today it's like it feels like heresy to even say that machines cannot be creative but back then I remember no had a tweet saying AI is never going to be creative and a lot of people said AI is never going to be creative so my entire thought process here is dude what we do creativity is just breaking things down rearranging it we already knew that and that's exactly what ended up happening but this combination this defense of you build your personal brand and you use this tool and your skills to create your own unique story is what you've become very successful at and that's what I've also become very successful at right with the AI Avatar we're using AI it's my story nobody else can make aun May AI AV because I would sue them uh because I own the rights to me it has worked out exactly as we put it down here this was the only defense against AI the personal brand combination with AI and your own understanding of the skill in the space which is amazing I feel like and that's what I want to talk to you right like I feel like we're at the end of the book at this point I wrote the job SP story and all that I feel like we've reached this the end of this book and I think the biggest differentiator between back then when we wrote the book and now it's not even remote work I think it is AI and now we have the chat gpts and the stable diffusions and so much more right so what I want to end on is I want to end on two things right one is now I want you to make three predictions okay it's going to be out of the blue I'm going to make three predictions about the next 5 six years um just like what the predictions made in the past you would have tried something new you you tried freelance back then you you saw upw workk and odesk work for you so you're like okay I'm going to extrapolate this over the next 10 years it's just going to keep going up because I see the value in this nobody believes me what is something nobody believes you on right now three things that you have tried you have some experience with and you can extrapolate and know it's going to become much bigger and of course there needs to be some profit there so number one outputs can be replicated but the thing that cannot be replicated is your unique story there is no second war Maya correct right uh so I think what's going to become really important is people lean into their personal experience personal story and express that in their work so I think the importance of expressing your taste being you know being let's just say authentic or being yourself the 100% version of yourself becomes super important I think in terms of design we might see individual siloed roles uh um kind of get less relevant over time I think the design role of the future probably looks something like a creative director this is somebody who has a unique set of experiences a unique set of global references for what they think is cool and is able to take that channel that into narratives So Stories into products into all the things that they create so that's number two creative director as the future role of design it's called a creative director somebody who's just like I'll use all the tools in front of me and AI in front of me and people in front of me to tell stories to the world to to to spread narrative in the world and to you know sort of make these products also shaped by narrative instead of being a generic yeah and number three I think marketing as we know it is dead um most advertising um let's talk about it right so I think most companies today uh think in terms of hey we need to do campaigns this campaign is going to be on TV newspapers you know the traditional advertising mindset I think we're already seeing at the edge that's changed for I think the future is companies hiring creators to run stuff but I think the future is companies realizing hey we need to not think in terms of Silo roles we need to think in terms of BX the brand experience across touch points and so I think marketing is likely not going to be a you know uh the kind of role it is today it'll be more about Community activations it's about defining the culture such that people understand what exactly this brand is about uh and it's going to become more about how do you have a unique brand voice that represents something uh and I think the people who do it will be um creative directors designers whether that's multiple mediums whether that's somebody who's a video editor who now wants to Branch out whether that's a uiu designer who's like hey I want to get into physical Street Wear I think that's how it plays out interesting I'll tell you three uh three this things I think the first thing is video is going to be huge I mean this is something we both agree on I guess I I mean the world agrees on I don't think this is the future anymore I think it's just shy of peak popularity I think next year it'll be Peak popularity after which there will be commoditization and whatnot um I think just I think I'm I'm going to make wild predictions I think the next TCS Vio blah blah blah is going to be made in video like I'm pretty sure of this right um just the sheer demand of people who want content is out of the roof because like we've mentioned right AI is automating everything so you're only concerned now about getting users there's two ways to get users either on ads or do content and content it really works you go speak to the guy called Ethan who runs something called parallel live it's like this one app okay and he's like he's grown the app to millions of users very quickly and he's like the only thing I do is influencer marketing I don't do anything else so everyone who's building an app who's building products who's doing d2c like the mama story is really on the back of lot of creators zero story is also on the back of a lot of affiliate creators in the early days I don't know if you know this so video has really mattered and people just prefer consuming video we have never had anyone consuming 5 hours of blog post a day the average person did not consume 5 hours of blog post per day but they are consuming four to 5 hours of video on screen time wise at least which is insane you and I considering we are creators we never used we never spent 5 hours reading blogs or or even the newspaper maybe we spent our parents ER spent 30 minutes an hour reading newspaper now it's like they're spending too much time on video that's number one I think video is going to be huge number two is I think games are going to be huge both I mean games are also pajama category I think it's the most under pajama category because if you look at my time where my time is going when I'm bored I'm sitting at home I'm just video gaming but that's also because I grew up gaming so it's exception but if you you sit in any flight in India and then you sit in the business class of the premium economy seats the people next to you will be slightly older slightly more well to-do and also really bored they pull out their phone they're not doing work nothing okay they pull out their phone they're playing video games and they're playing Candy Crush and like like the boring game so as borom increases as AI automates more tasks and roles people want new experiences they want to be immersed in a new world and they want it to be on mobile phones so mobile phone Gaming controllers are going to be big games are going to be big uh you know making games is going to be more and more important as we saw with Wukong recently right they're now going to like push the boundary of making games uh and it's not only going to be games it's also going to be experiences you saw the the new glasses by meta right oron I mean it's it's pretty obvious that at some point we are going to be living in a world where 3D creatures near you you're playing Pokemon in the real world like what you're doing right now like what you're recording right now right so I feel we are going to be in that world and it's not very far away the third prediction and actually I have four but I'll tell you the third one anyway I think work from home is not a good idea for early stage companies I think if you're a mature Company by all means work from home but I think you can't do pajama profit as an early stage company you know how our done this book if I was doing it today I would have gone in the real world met the hund somehow met physically at an event or whatever like people saying networking is for idiots or whatever it's for idiots if you've already have some story for yourself but I think in the early days you absolutely have to network I would go meet the wealthiest people in India the people who are actually hiring the people who are at businesses build physical relationships with them cuz that you can unlock a lot of money when you build physical relation relationships IRL IRL in real life right because and people also do better over time so if you know somebody today 5 years later they will suddenly have the capital deployment ability 10 times as what they had 5 years ago so building those deep relationships matters helping those companies grow actually matters in the early days and it is a physical role so it wouldn't be pajama profit it would be pant profit or trouser profit right where you actually have to go in the physical Street or cargo profit right where you're wearing caros and going around because the most comfortable thing to wear so I feel work from home is super overrated for young people once you become successful once you already have a brand very easy for you to get more project sit at home by all means 30s by 35 you should be able to sit at home that's fine should not start your career like this do you agree yeah I think uh IRL relationships underrated importance of community we talked about it the physical Community I mean colleges are all about Community it's a four-year Community experience we don't remember the classes we remember the relationships as a part of my life I miss the most yeah I'm sure with you as well right like if I had to choose one thing I miss is like just College not class but College yeah and it's worth every rupee ever spent yeah right it's the one thing I don't regret at all in terms of spend right so I feel like if you can create that for others it matters if you're part of that it matters for your life you sitting at home what memories are you making you're sitting at home doing the same thing routine you know life burns out very quickly when you're doing that what memories are you making what new stuff have you done you're making a little bit of more money you're doing it without having to be in an office on time great but you're missing out on the entire experiences that your peers are having I'm sure at our office they like bunch of people who are going out having fun at night I don't know but I'm sure it feels somewhat to call we try to make it as much to especially for the young people to make it feel as much as college so I think you'll ruin your career doing work from home in the beginning of your career but later on I understand the last point is around coding and I think I should clarify my thoughts on it but first I want to hear your thoughts on code yeah see I don't see code AS somebody who was a who did computer science I no longer see code as a skill I don't see code as a thing to do I see code more as a material as a thing you get to play with right and so today as a designer I'm not locked thinking about or should design or code I'm thinking about okay I think for my full creative expression I need to be comfortable with as many materials as many mediums as possible and code is a strong one yeah I what I think I think writing code will die it will become English at some point but engineering will live on Sid from my team from 100x Team keeps saying this he's like bro the reason we named it 100x engineers and not 100x coders is because we don't know what's going to happen to cord and it's pretty like you you seen replate agents and all it's pretty it's pretty clear that you're going to have to have English but still knowing what to say and what the computer can do still requires you to know how to code M so it's almost like you learn the skill but then you use English to implement the skill because you need to learn the limitations of the computer you need to learn for example simple stuff right like you can't make a game without knowing how pixels are rendered on the screen yeah right I'm talking about the the actual 3D models how they're rendered how light works in a game engine you need to know all of that so you already need to know all that theory cuz only then can you prompt the system to say I want this character doing this I want this animation at this time if you don't understand how State machines work you won't understand how animation loops work yeah so it's stuff like that so you need to know the concepts you need to be a coder but you might not write code M it's like this right it's like the best example I can give is that of a warrior you need to know how to swing the sword okay you need to know how to hold the sword which swords feel good which swords feel bad how to sharpen it but then you are no longer the one going and Swinging The Sword in battle you are the strategist you are telling the three swordsman either you're telling the four flank him from the right side you're telling him don't use these swords use guns instead because this is the this angle is blocked that's what we'll all be doing and if you don't understand how swords work or how guns work or how the swords man works yeah then you are never going to be able to do battle strategy well so it's sort of like that coding is learning how to code is important but coding might not be as important that's my analysis of this which is where I think the future will head amazing I think how have our predictions held up I'd say pretty well um it says the Millennials guide um because we were Millennials back then but I think any jenz who read this had a massive advantage over uh their peers and now it's played out there like lots of 25 26 year olds who are like bro pajama profit Kickstart My Career like I didn't even know all this existed I was going to go do some chemical engineering and then be some chemical engineering guy somewhere I didn't even know all these internet roles existed yeah which is awesome like did you expect the impact you wouldd have from this no and a lot of that is invisible so in fact I still don't know it yeah um every once in a while I hear somebody mention it um I know we've written this book I know there's a lot of our own life experience that we've put into it uh but it was many years ago and so I feel like maybe it might be time for um the next version I'm so surprised we've been on the internet for 7 eight years and it's still holding up yeah should have been canceled by now all right that's about it thank you all for joining I hope you learned something from this video make sure you like subscribe abov has a channel too yeah check out my channel it's ABN ux I also run 10K designers you

Lol JK.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swE9V4otTWw", "transcript": "this Chinese game just broke world records for being one of the most played games ever blacksmith Wukong hit 2.2 million concurrent players on Steam within hours of release that's more than any other single player game ever but what makes this game so special in this video I will explain why the success of Wukong is a masterclass in marketing and why I don't see India pulling this off anytime soon now a disclaimer for all the Fanboys of the game I agree that it is an amazing game with a challenging yet interesting story combined with state-of-the-art gam playay I also agree that for any half serious gamer worth their salt Wukong is not an overnight success I have been waiting for it forever myself there's no denying that a good part of its success has to be attributed to the developers having said that there are some key decisions taken by game science developers of Wukong that helped Propel it out of the stratosphere almost nobody talks about this but the game development behem 10cent owns a 5% stake in game science I'm willing to bet that they are the ones cracking deals with American companies which helped it become relevant in pop culture look at this box I don't think people understand how big of a deal it is to get Nvidia yes that envidia which has been on this crazy growth for the past couple of years and is at the Forefront of this AI Revolution to put your game on their gpus there are also some unconfirmed reports about a deal with PlayStation also the hype and anticipation for this game were not made overnight game science dropped the first demo of the game back in 2020 and they have been building the hype ever since other than Nvidia game science also partnered with luck and coffee which is basically the Starbucks of China the coffee house launched a dedicated Americano named after Wukong along with some merch like 3D posters and unsurprisingly everything sold out instantly game science even cracked TV Partnerships Chinese appliance manufacturer hense launched an exclusive picture mode named after Wukong in their select TVs I will now tell you why it's not possible to make a Wukong in India firstly there is no AAA PC game Market in India f a look at this statistic the PC market in India is not even 10% of the mobile market moreover unlike mobiles where you could play a high-end game like pubg even on an entry-level smartphone most of these PCS are incapable of playing a game like Wukong or Red Dead Redemption 2o now you might say vun there isn't a big AAA PC game Market in China either and you would have been right 5 years ago but things have changed a little since then China is currently the second largest market for steam right behind America India doesn't even show up in the top 10 game science originally started out as mobile game developers in 2014 and only moved to the AAA PC game Market in 2018 after having a couple of successes in Mobile and seeing a surge in PC gaming in the country steam got officially launched in China in 2021 which further provided a distribution channel for game science a channel that later proved to be really lucrative even other Chinese game devs were waiting for a AAA PC game to get both domestic and international success as as it has created a noticeable shift towards premium game development Soul frame lyang the director of Phantom Blade zero another Chinese AAA PC game commented that if black myth Wukong succeeds in the domestic and international market people would be confident about other games in their industry and that he thought that it would indeed be a large success India simply doesn't have enough steam users to create that kind of demand but this National success is just one part of the equation which brings me to reason number two wukong's Success is Not only from China now it sold 10 million copies in 3 days because somehow through its genius marketing whether it be the Nvidia deal using steam slipstream or other Partnerships it was able to become a global phenomenon the good news is they marketed a good product it cost game science 75 million over 6 years to make it that's around 555 CR no investor Market in India is ready to put up that kind of money in PC gaming why because India hasn't had a proven success in PC gaming yet only after one success can other products follow along watch my video on slipstreams to learn more about this I'm sure once we have one case study there would be 10 more investors understand that India to Us distribution is really a hard problem they know even if they were able to build such a game marketing it to the world would be challenging we have seen traces of that happening in film and TV thanks to OTS but we are yet to see that in the gaming industry in my previous company we built and marketed SAS products games are slightly different but it is the same philosophy you build software in in this case a game and you are trying to export that software outside of your own country and let me tell you it is extremely difficult moreover SAS is B2B this is almost B Toc which makes it an even harder problem to solve they even had to cross a language barrier on top of that Wukong is originally in Chinese and had to be translated to English there are even some mations in the game there is a counterflow skill in the game which is mistranslated to some extent it takes a lot of luck and some legendary deal making to get those steam topping charts I saw early demos of Wukong 4 years ago no no investor in India has that kind of patience curve for a non-existent industry people associate India with both art and development but due to the education Rat Race in India these have become fields that seldom intersect with each other a developer would not care about storytelling or design and an artist would not care about how their ideas are executed game development is the ultimate Fusion of design and code it has to be led by a person who understands both along with a third skill marketing unlike most things it is not another engineering problem that can be outsourced to infosis and by the way I 100% believe that it is technically possible to make a game like Wukong in India people think we do not have the tech resources for that and that's not true advancements in Ai and Unreal Engine have made a lot of tech commoditized even Wukong apart from its interesting storytelling and breathtaking Graphics is a pretty straightforward game a lot of the problems they had to do the hard way have been solved for us because Wukong started development in 2018 they used motion tracking suits for for animations but now you can do animations using a tool called move. a there are even a lot of websites where you can get animations from Wukong developers actually had to go and take 3D scans of rocks and many other elements they had to include in the game but you can already get these scans for free from epic games using quickel Bridge which provides 3D scans of numerous assets to add to the game environment similarly you can also use the unreal Locomotion system which works really well as well India has all the talent too many of the Hollywood Blockbusters you watch Interstellar or Avatar were animated in India Rockstar Games has a studio in Bangalore which worked on Red Dead Redemption 2 you would even find an inventory system as a plugin for Unreal Engine however the engineer needs to be an artist wukong's real strength is in its art Direction and story it is like a movie that you can play it might not take 550 crores for us to make it but there still needs to be a market for it lastly even if we can solve all these problems there are a lot of cultural roadblocks ahead Wukong is based on Chinese mythology imagine if we did that in India how many people would it upset in God of War you basically go around killing NS Gods we can't even think about something like that in Wukong you can go bash up the four Heavenly gods that a lot of people actually go pray to I doubt the sensitivities of the Indian audience would allow that there needs to be some amount of creative freedom for this to exist the problem is we need a Founder type person who at least has these three skills development design and marketing now if you have these three skills you can do hundreds of other businesses in India and make tens of crores selling some old school offline stuff does it make sense for that person to take this bet why would they take the risk of being cancelled if you can do 100 other things and make more money it makes no sense which is why you need someone who already has a lot of money and has these three skills this is exactly what game science did they developed successful mobile games and made money from it and then developed a tripa PC game from that experience and revenue but in India we built the mobile game developers from not making a AAA PC game a lot of companies like gameberry in India are currently making mobile games and making the best use of the Google Play Store to grow we are counting on many of these developers to create AAA PC games in the future as a video game fanatic and a proud Indian I hope we are able to overcome these problems going forward because personally I believe Indian history mythology is so rich and has so much to offer probably more than any other country it should be put out there for the world to see but until that day comes I would think twice before putting in my imaginary $ million to build a AAA PC game in India hoping that day comes soon"}

{"video_id": "DkKPqmCYEws", "title": "We Ranked Top Indian Entrance Exams for 2024", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkKPqmCYEws", "transcript": "from a perspective I think I is already very highly rated in India but if it's stated 9 by 10 I don't think it's stated with the right reasons if I do upsc what kind of jobs can I expect how much money do they make so you get probably like over a lck in just basic salary but there are ton of bugs my personal belief is that if you don't get into a top college outside India for MBA you should not go there even if you go from a top college perspective I would highly recommend to probably come back to India I feel like being at the top really matters because a pure Network in the MBs is more important than what you're being taught because what you're being taught honestly is not as important as you being in the same classroom as some other really brilliant G like how did you actually get to global scale what's the secret for you as an app to get to 2 million people so quickly ladies and gentlemen welcome back to another episode of the tier list today we're going to rank something that I know is very special to many of you which is which entrance exam should I go give what is the scope in 2024 how much money can I make what's the competition you know what we're going to do on this show uh you know all the fun stuff that's coming you have to stay till the end of the video and look I'm not really an expert at entrance exams I know some of them uh I've given some of them maybe 10 years ago but what I wanted is I wanted to get somebody who is successful but also has given these entrance exams recently right as recent as a year or two years ago so that he has the most context about this space so today I have aay with me from stimula aay you have both you have given entrance exams very recently you're still young and at the same time you run a very successful company which actually does English upskilling right which allows people to have a conversation with an English AI assistant and many of the users of your app have actually are actually using it to go give ISS and stuff like that so you have so much understanding of the space now both as an entrepreneur and two years ago as uh you know uh an individual going and giving these exams before we begin before we start rating I would love to know your story like a very very quick a bridged version and then we'll get started perfect so very excited to do this because I was in this boat a couple of years back but yeah I air I'm 23 I graduated out of ibhu doing engineering last year and in college I was mostly doing a bunch of things debating and stuff and stuff and in my third year I started a company which Von briefly talked about so stimula allows you to get better at English conversational skills we want to build a global consumer Tech brand from India have over 2 million users from 200 plus countries so happy to talk more about it but really excited to do this the way I'm going to approach this particularly is if someone if a sibling of mine in class 12th or a third or fourth year of engineering ask me which exam should I give what is the pros and cons of this exam the advice I will try to give them is the advice I will try to have in this so of course some of these exams are pretty controversial so super excited to do this so you have 2 million users on your app right what do people do on your app primar they come in they have this AI ofar called Sara so you can talk with Sara on different themes like Hobbies families you can talk about scenarios for example negotiating a salary with your manager or for example giving an interview so you can talk the best part is feedback so you get analyzed on every single thing about your speech so from your s ands to pauses to fluency to pronunciation every single thing and you get told what to do better so it's an objective way of improving your conversational skills lovely okay so now that we have context let's go through the entrance exams I can already see what the first one is so let's just begin with that it is the iitj 2024 where would you rank this okay so I have an obvious bias in here I have given this exam I've spent two years of so super high grinding in Kota for preparing for itg you went to Kota yes I went to Kota for this so you are a product of the Kota Factory unfortunately so basically uh I would still rank at in s now there's a reason for that so from a perspective I think IAT is already very highly rated in India I don't need to speak much about it but if it's stated 9 by 10 I don't think it's stated to the right reasons yeah so people dat i because of placements I think the much bigger part or better part of being in an i is just the peer group you get in right I'm going to give you two examples because in my first year I started getting an interest in debating I try to do it at a better level now I had a club in it I had a teammate in it and by the third year I was doing debating at the World Championships that's the scale you can get into any single activity in iot second part I wanted to start a startup by the time I graduated out of my college I already had three co-founders i' had already raised a ton of money and you already know those co-founders are smart yeah I know that they are smart they are different interests they have similar motivations so you know all of those things you're able to get those people and that's the best part about being an IT the reason I put in as though is not just because of that because even if you don't get into an it I think the tech world has leveled so much that even if you are in a probably an nit or a bitset or a different College you still have opportuni to get into Tech and your engineering degree would be valuable plus you can do other things also so you're saying giving the J allows you to get into some of those secondary colleges yes so you can get into nits for example through J and all of these calls are still helpful in terms that you can go definitely further into Tech but more importantly you have your option open so much of the people who would be watching this video for example would have zero clue of what probably they should go about and if that's the case I always recommend go for IJ because you would get at least options with that so that's the number one thing the only caveat here I would add is that if you do have a strong interest in something else please don't get like persu into iatg I know a couple of friends who were great at social sciences for example but they still wasted two years of their life in preparing for J and until they realize this 2 years we gone which is the most important period in a education life so I think that's the only caveat but if you don't have a clue or if you are inclined even slightly towards engineering or Tech go for IJ lovely so that's the iitj that's the default we had to start with that next let us do upsc okay so my mom is not going to be happy about ranking it lower but I'll give it to you you should rank it first yeah so I would probably rank it at a B okay so I'll will tell you the reason behind it so I think the important thing to note here is that the ranking would be very different for two different use cases right so someone in class 9th or 10th or 11th or 12th who is thinking about upsc very seriously I would still probably rank it at an a form them perspect their perspective because you can probably choose Humanities you can choose things which favor I upsc syllabus for that matter and you can spend your four years through that but if you are someone who has graduated from an engineering College if you are in a tech job or if you are looking for a tech job or something like that and then you are considering okay societal pressure is high for example I from biad right if you're from a bihad or up or reasons where UPS is very highly respected and you think that okay I should leave my tech job and probably go for a upsc I would strongly advise against it Prim for two reasons again it's a very very very difficult thing to crack I think that there are lots of people appearing in it you would literally have probably 100 great seats probably thousand seats to begin with and that's a very low percentage so that's one and you'll be competing with those people who show made that decision in class 9 or 10 perspective so that's the one thing to consider right the second thing is that what happens is that people don't give up on upsc once they have chosen it so a lot of people when they start preparing for upsc they probably do it for one year but then they think that okay I probably missed it by 5 10 marks let me give it another chance so if you see the average number of times a person takes a upsc examination that's often three or four and that means that suddenly you were you see resumes and I see that a lot when we hiring you see resumes where the person excellent Tech graph the person was doing something probably great in Tech Samsung any any other company right they were doing some tech job for 2 years then they took a four-year break through to upsc when they realized it didn't work out for them then they return back suddenly there's a huge gap right between you and your peers between you and your peers plus you have probably missed out on Tech so say someone take the example of someone who was probably in a tech company in 2019 certainly they took a break for upsa they realized that okay I'm probably five marks s let's try it again and again and again the thing about UPS say is that you are never too far but in order to really make it in it's a long effort right and for example in I if you don't get into IAT you still get into an nit you still get into a triple it that didn't happen in from an upsc perspective if you don't get into upsc the second option which is probably like an SS for example there there's a huge gap in between and your mind somehow doesn't let you go for that and because say you have from I you are from a good engineering college so now that you have come back in 2024 in Tech you realize that that is where I want to be you suddenly so behind your peers you have missed one or two waves and waves play a lot of so you know nothing about AI if you took a Gap a for example and today if a resume has nothing about AI honestly because most of the roles have some component of it especially in cool companies or you know like the new a companies so now you are just much behind your peers and I see these resumes every day so if you are someone who is in Tech right now or who and specifically in AI right if you have anything which do do with AI chances are that in the next four to five years it will be better or bigger so I would recommend you to leave it all and go for upsc which is something which is much lesser chance the only say scenario in which I will still recommend you to go for upsc is that if you are comfortable that okay I have to go in a government job if I don't clear upsc I will go for State Public Service Commission if I don't clear that I will go for an SS if I don't clear that I will still go for a banking and you are very comfortable with that drop if you are in that scenario go for it otherwise don't know if I if I do upsc what kind of jobs can I expect at the end of it so the jobs are pretty good you get into a public service job which is basically very highly respected so for example I can tell you that in my family uh an entrepreneur would be respected much less than a public service person for that matter and this is true for the entire Strat of society right so specifically in probably like non-metros how much money do they make so it's pretty cool right so you get probably like over a lck in just basic salary but there are ton of bus okay so you have a ton of bus then you have bonuses for projects like a government given house car house car people to work with you your phone bills your electricity bills there are a lot of things which add up to and like you said the respect is a huge factor I think that's the biggest factor for being in a public service job not just from respect from your parents but respect from your society and if that matters really big for you I think I can understand why you are considering upsc but yeah if you are considering that be prepared that you might not get in and then you should have a b plan in government job and go only if you have that b plan okay so next we we have the clat the clat the clat what does the clat do so this is an exam you need to clear if you want to go get into a legal field okay common law admission test yes and this is not too popular so if I say like probably less than a lck people give it okay and you have to give it in class 12th by the way so this competes directly with the likes of an i z or a neat and that's the reason I know it's like I'm not too like sure about between s and a but I will for now I will place it on S the reason I'm placing this is here that and I'm again thinking from a perspective of person who has still not made a decision if you have interest in public speaking if you if you believe that you can articulate yourself if you believe that you can work hard because legal profession actually requires you to work really hard if you can believe those things then clad is a great option for you because what clad does is you only competing with probably 60,000 people not too many people know about it and it's at the end of the day it's all a supply demand thing right the world the India needs lawyers there are so many cases pending every single company has corporate lawyers we work with a ton of lawyers ourselves so India needs lawyers right but at the same time and there are colleges for it also for example there are nlus and there are some very like decent nlus nlu is a national law University and they are just like iats there are classes of nlus for example there are top nlus for example your say nsar Hyderabad or there are probably not newer nus for the example right but there are still 2K to 2.5k good seats in clad and the difference is that for 2K or 5K good seats in IJ you competing with 20 lakh people and all of those people have been told so much about iatc that they care about that exam competition the competition is there people care about that exam people probably being quota for that I Was preparing qu with five lakh people right for cl that competition didn't exist to that degree right so you can if you have an interest and the only caveat here is that you sort have an interest in things which a lawyer does right of course you might not know about lawyer that stays that's completely fine but you should be able to understand about okay I am good at articulating things I am good at probably discussions I am probably good at say for example you have your moods in college or you have mu or you have all those things if you have signals that you are good at those things if you have signals that you want to be in a role where probably the respect is little bit higher side you have longer working hours if those things are fine with you I would recommend you to go for cl how much do lawyers make a lot so you can start with probably say like a 10 to 12 LS job but on a higher level a top lawyer will make much more because lot of these lawyers how much is much more probably like a CR more than that because you have usually have so the best lawyers are independent right and they have the best clients they have the best clients and they have multiple clients so it's entrepreneurial in nature in a way and the best lawers like ultimately they do go on an entrepreneur nature even from a particular smaller client you probably charge two Ls a month and then you just can just imagine that and you don't need a that big of a team you can probably be two or three full-time People Partners and stuff so from a that perspective from a career scope perspective pay perspective I think clat is a good exam to give from a 12th class perspective got it not many people know about clad because it's not sexy but there still seems to be both respect both some of the respect of upsc some of the money of the Jes yeah and there's a little bit of diversity here also right so you can be a say public lawyer which is a very different trajectory you can be a corporate lawyer again we a different trajectory and after clearing clat you can in fact like probably give a couple of exams and become a judge which is a completely different trajectory a different set of respect different set of pay so you do have decent diversity in here also compared to something very specific sort of okay so next we have the neat exam okay yeah so this was the choice I had to make in class 10 so I have like some opinion about it I think I would rank it at a B okay okay I will go a I will tell you why I switched from B to a so the problem with neat is it is very competitive right so it's same competitive as an IJ but I you can probably like do nothing in your college life and then still have an option to revive your career later on yeah me is different right lot of the Top Doctors you see in India for example they had excellent colis Ras the second thing with about neat is it's a long journey so I will tell you like about a cousin of mine who is studying in as Patna he's one of the most the brightest kids I know he went into college alongside me right at this point of time he's probably still 3 to 4 years away from practicing being a medic medic right but I am already in a workplace lot of people at this point of time people spend at least like 8 to 10 years so because in need you have to do an Uzi right you're undergraduate okay but undergraduate is never enough so you have to do a PG and then even after PG if you want to be someone who is like probably well sought after you would probably do a specialization after your pz so it's a long journey and it's a very tough Journey so I know like personally know that these people usually don't have any sort of Freedom at all you have very tough schedules especially even in your pz that's even tougher because you have to treat actual patients so it's not just tougher in terms of say for example I can say that I work 12 hours a day and they also work 12 hours a day but my 12 hours a day works involves working on the computer right I can take a walk around and still work on a mobile phone there are 12 hours of the day involves acting a very serious Stone because you are working on actual patients you dealing with life you are dealing with like for example diseases and all so in that term s is a very stressful job and so it's a high stress thing now the reason I will still put it on a is I personally know a lot of people who derive great pleasure in it because they essentially feel that they want to help most people so out of all the things we have addressed you know like some people might say that upsc is the best way to help most people but I personally feel that neat is that because you actually become a doctor you can save lives and like there's a lot of correlation between that so I think like in that terms I personally know of a lot of people who feel that neat is just they're just too passionate about it uh they want to help more people and they're ready to put in extra efforts for it so from that perspective NE is good the also second thing is the pay is great so if you are able to go through this you know like line of fire or whatever you can call it so if you're able to go through this 10 years or 8 to 10 years there a very successful career awaiting at the end of it it will be stressful but in terms of pure you know PESA and you if you're comparing from that perspective there's a lot of money in this okay how much money would the top doctors make so the top doctor will made in multiple cor and that's like much bigger than probably like a top engineer not in an entrepreneur set I think that's a very different thing yeah but like in even in top as similar to entrepreneur entrepreneurship is okay like in the sense you could be a doctor and then start your own Hospital in which case you'll make even more right yeah that's what I say similar to how you have in clat where you are if you're a top lawyer you will start your own Independent Business if you're to doctor you will start your own Independent Business and then the upside is infinite so if you think from that perspective need does have a lot of respect at the end of it and money at the end of it the only problem is it's much yeah it's much difficult than I a to go through so if you're ready for that grind and I think the country needs more doctors so from that perspective need is a good choice got it so next let's go after I think the this should be special to you right like the ISS I feel like um uh one of the things you were telling me before we got online before we started doing this was that you said a lot of the people that use your app stimul are actually training for the ISS right so you know a lot about this entrance exam uh tell us where you rank it and what you know about it so so I think like other than having a lot of people use stimler to prepare for it I have given this exam myself so I have some perspective from that and the problem with ranking it with these exams is that is a need to exam so you don't uh you don't like aspire to be an is ranker in your class 10 right there's no aspiration associated with that you Aspire with probably studying abroad and this is the key to that right so for example specifically with is so it stands for uh International English language testing system and it's basically mandatory in lot of colleges you want to study in specifically in UK I think this is much more mandatory we would probably have toile which is much more mandatory in us so in ISS uh specifically you only need to do it if you want to go abroad the good thing about ISS though compared to say for example something like a gr or GMAT is that it's easy and what is what I mean that it's easy from a perspective right so it won't require you to prepare for 6 months or 2 years or one year you can probably prepare it in 1 month or 2 month the thing is that it depends a lot on how your English level has been throughout your career because uh say for example a lot of exams have English so for example if you want to get to an MBA you have to clear cat right and cat has an English section yeah the difference between English section of a cat and an ilts is that you don't just have to probably remember vocabulary you just don't have to probably know a lot of words or be able to understand passages yeah but you actually have to speak right and the one of the sections in is so I has four sections so you have reading listening speaking and writing yeah right so in the speaking section you actually have a conversation so there's a onetoone interviewer or a person sitting in front of you often from a native country and you need to have a 15 minutes conversation with them so and that conversation is often impromptu right so you are not given a script to speak you are basically asked questions on the go about yourself about random topics in the world about some experience of yours and you have to give a very structured answer you have to do be fluent pronunciation and stuff so from that perspective it might be difficult for someone who is not from a English native background because you know like knowing the language in terms of knowing words or being able to understand English I feel that's really different from being able to have a conversation in that language that's one of the reasons why we started stimul also right so the reason a lot of people use stimula for ILS is because you are able to have this environment inside the app right where you are in front of an interviewer or an AI who is acting like an interviewer who is which is very uh like similar as of now today so you have this interviewer you are sitting with them you have 15 minutes exact conversation and they can act on the go just like a normal inter word does and it can then rank you on the same metrics ilts exam ranks you on so while the listening and reading section are easier to prepare because you often have material available for it the speaking section is one where non-native English speakers find the most difficulty in and this is where stimul helps them into we also help them in writing which is more about being able to sort of uh put your thoughts down be able to structure it and stuff so that is also what we help in but primarily our goal is to help people in I speaking and that is where people use it for today so this is one of the biggest use cases people use and you also said I helps you attack like as stimula like a global market yes right you're able to go after everybody else like how did you actually get to global scale what's the secret for you as an app to get to 2 million people so quickly so I think there a lot of factors came into play uh there's a lot of luck involved there's a lot of strategy involved so from beginning because my background was in debating right so I was able to do a lot of global debating across 15 different countries so I knew that the global landscape in conversation skills or the aspiration to be speak English I that's similar across country side that is something we really knew about and then also there's a because we starting in college there's an ambition Factor you want to be the first company to do this and for us that was that we wanted to be the first company which has probably 100 million users and less than 20 million is from India right that is the consumer Tech out of India brand we wanted to build now a few things happened first due to our debating Network and other network I reached out to a person on Twitter which is from Indonesia I asked her to review the app she Ed about writing that about a thread about app right and what happened was it caught a viral wave so stimula has a feature where you probably do a conversation and then you get feedback which is the first time an app does that right because you could be graded on your grammar and vocabulary before also but the ability to Jud probably your pronunciation or your fluency that's something which has been Possible only the last couple of years right so we are able to give you that and that scoring part simply got a viral wave in Indonesia and the thing about ilts is that it's a doorway to go abroad right and this doorway while this is very prevalent in India it's not limited to India so for example someone sitting in in a Colombia or for example a Peru they also want to go abroad for example someone sitting in Indonesia they also want to study abroad right there still one test it's still one test and they all give this so for example I think globally probably 6 to 7 million people give ilts each year and lot of these people are outside India I remember someone from the team telling me that they've read about you in the newspaper that's our the first interaction with you right like that that was also part of you going viral in a way yeah uh so that was majorly because of Google Play honestly so uh we have been a Google Play partner for a long time I think Google Play was the reason we got this much viral also because because once we had this Indonesia vity and due to ilt as some Global audience Bas and over the next five six months the App Store optimization which is your app version of SEO for example that got us a lot of downloads from all over the world so we were able to see which countries the app really resonates with and we able to build with that then we were a part of app scale Academy where they taught us how best app scale what is app scale Academy so it's an academy for 100 most promising app based startups out of India this is by Google this is by Google Play and then they are able to help you with scaling help you with design help you with security so they gave each of the startups of security report and all and then in December last year we also won Google Play's best AI app of 2023 next Let's Take on the cat let's see if where you'll Bell the Cat okay so I will place it at a okay so now again this is very relevant for people who are already in a undergrad degree right so they are in an undergrad degree and they are deciding if they want to go for business or not the good thing about cat is it's a lowrisk high reward thing I will explain you how because most of the people give cat in their fourth year of college okay or they give it after 2 years in workplace right I will cover the first part because I gave cat in that period right I was just giving it for fun but I give cat in that period the one good thing about cat is that the syllabus is very similar to the placement test you will give so if you're an engineering student who is not preparing for coding jobs much of your placement test would involve logical reasoning English Quant and all those things and this is exactly what a syllabus of a cat is Cat exam is so you don't need to put in extra efforts for that of course you need to prepare if you really want to get into an IM a BC for example or the top imag colleges in India you need to put in effort but that effort is not too difficult for you if you're an engineering GR now the situation of cat changes completely if you're non-engineering grad because the English so cat is four sections right Quant English lrdi so three sections sorry Quant English and lrdi right out of that Quant is very easy for engineering students because the Quant level is not too high what is Quant for the audience Quant is basically your mathematics basic arithmetics and stuff like that so that is more of a class 10 to class 12 level which is easier for an engineering student but if you go beyond engineering for those people Quant is very tough because that's not something they have been studying for the last like an economics student would not have yes so for them English is the easier part Quant is a difficult part from a switch the sites and for them English is the tougher part and English takes less time to prepare than a Quant for example so that sense then you need to prepare for two three months for cat the upside is that cat is accepted in a lot of colleges in India so if you want to get into business you feel that your engineering is not from a top degree and you feel that you can't get into opportunities so right now in the last two three years I think a lot of opportunities are opening up in business at the undergraduate level also so for example product management or for example marketing rules also though that's very limited but if you feel that you're not getting those opportunities in the fourth year you can apply for cat probably alongside your placements and stuff and then the whole management World opens up for you and getting into an IM for example is lifechanger for now because if you get into an IM for example and a top I am at that the chances increase a lot and the competition is not that high compared to the competition at an undergrad level for what kind of money can these people make if if you do well at a cat and get into the best I am so I think I am ahmedabad's average package was somewhere on 30 25 to 30 L yes and I think that was a year back so I'm not sure how that has grown or evolved over the time but I think this is also increasing a lot right because these are mostly gists and I think like you might probably agree with that that in AI World specifically journalists can do a lot of things so a lot of these people start their companies so if you see I think like there was this stat that probably I don't know 80% of Indian unicorns are from IM am fers so I am not sure about that number but I think that is a interesting so it's a good path eventually to become a Founder but my own opinion of MB is if you're going to the top one's great but if you by mistake getting into a like a second tier or a third tier MBA like it actually makes your life harder and I'll make a separate video about that but uh I feel like being at the top really matters because a pure Network in the mbas is more important than what you're being taught because what you're being taught honestly is not as important as you being in the same classroom as some other really brilliant generalist I think that's true for a lot of these things right even from an iot perspective I think what we were taught is only important if you're going in a code engineering field even from a CSC perspective that I UNC count in CAD also the management relations while they are important for example if you want to go into traditional management for example in HL or that field but if you want to go to Tech or if you want to start a company I think the pr group is much more important so agree with you in that got it next let's go to the gate so gate in India I will put it at B okay so again the bias here is that gate is great for people who probably are interested in the core field so if you're a mechanical undergrad so gate basically is given by people in college or just outside right and if you are someone who is interested in mechanical engineering for example you can give gate and get into a mechanical Masters and then that mtech is useful because you're M because you are getting understanding in that degree right as I told that if you are studying in an i if you are in a core degree you can still learn something so you can learn more in mtech and you can be more valuable to the industry yeah the second thing is lot of people give gate for okay maybe I can do an mtech in csse or I'm taking it so I can tell you from my personal experience I was also a part of placement cell of IBU while I was in college right I can tell you from my personal experience that doesn't happen so if a company is hiding from a tech perspective they don't give that much extra value to an mtech compared to a btech so if someone someone did A B Tech from a similar College went to any tech company spent a couple of years working on their skills or projects or stuff they probably valued more than that the person who chose an mtech after that interesting and that is something I have seen in terms of hiring that I have seen in terms of placements again it might be a sample bias because of like probably in an iph perspective or from other colleges perspective but I think that is true in what I have seen other colleges also the good part about cat gate for example is that you can also use it as a placement test I'll give an example of that so a lot of public sector companies in India PSU specifically they hire through gate right so for example if you want to get into a gale uh which is basically the gas Authority limit of India if you want into a gale for example you can give gate and you can get into that so for example you don't want to do an mtech right but you are still interested in a mean mechanical engineering job or an Electronics engineering job so again you because the gate syllabus is mostly based on your subject so gate for in CSC differs from gate for a mechanical engineer right so if you're going from a gate for a mechanical engineering perspective you can give that exam if you get a good rank you also get admission in mtex if you want but you can also use that rank to get into psus directly so if you want to use it as a placement test and because you have already studied that subject for four years then this is a good alternative for me okay so next I have two more in front of me but I think they're kind of similar the GMAT and the gr right I you have thoughts on GMAT versus gr so I will tell you the basic differentiation between that the differentiation is what colleges it unlocks for you okay so for example say you want to go into a foreign MBA right by the way like both of these exams are required to go into studying abroad again okay along with il along with il so I is for English proficiency this is more for your aptitude Proficiency in that matter what is aptitude stand for for the audience so aptitude is basically your ability to answer questions on the go your ability to think analytically so that is basically what they test and the difference between that is for example if GMAT is basically for MBA right so if you want an admission in a foreign MBA college you would have to clear GMAT okay now the caveat is some colleges have started accepting both gmad and G for MBA also but mostly it's for gmad the one extra benefit for GMAT is that you also can get admission in ISB which is the Indian School of Business which is one of the best MBA colleges alongside your top I Im so that is an extra benefit with GMAT unlocks for you so you might be wondering if someone doesn't want to go outside does they still have a probably a meaning for GMAT yes probably for ISP but other than that very similar exams so you have your English you have your uh math or Quant these are the two basic ideas English is slightly on the tougher side here compared to cat this is like not too big of a difference but if you're preparing for a GMAT or a g because the differentiation is that you have to probably prepare for say for example a lot of vocabulary this is for in GMAT and what is the difference between G why is gr easier so Z is not easier as such I'm saying that g is also very similar in syllabus the exam format is different so for example in fact G is slightly tougher than GMAT right because G has probably two essays in St of one in GMAT G probably has a slightly higher in English level compared to your GMAT so in that term Z is a slightly tougher exam but in in terms of that I will probably place it both at an a only okay so let's just put both at a because it often like again it's a need to exam you probably will give it uh and where does the GRE get you like if I crack the GRE versus the GMAT what are the opportunities like so if you clear G it's often required for you doing a Masters of Science so Ms so if you want to do an MS in an foreign College I think G is a great exam for you and that's the basic difference between G and GMAT so the format is different the subjects are same and the difficulty level is slightly higher in GRE but yeah that's controversial by the way like one interesting thing which happened with GMAT is that the format has changed a bit so they are trying to prioritize Quant a little bit more so mathematical ability because if you think about it they're already able to judge your English proficiency by or a toy Fel because I also has a reading test or a listening test so they able to judge your vocabulary through that so they a they are slightly increasing the proficiency and I think the average scores will come down a bit due to that because a lot of people who give are not that good in math for example but from that perspective I think GMAT is slightly prioritizing Quant I'm not sure about what kind of jobs do you get after the GMAT and gr so depends a lot on so both are very different in that terms right because if you do a foreign MBA for example now foreign MBA the PE group is even better if you get from a top college right my personal belief is that if you don't get into a top college outside India for MBA you should not go there because I think like even if you go from a top college perspective I would highly recommend to probably come back to India I'm a big believer of the India growth story in that terms and I also think that if you don't if you get from a probably a tier three College it doesn't add value to your resume based on the amount it cost you and it costs a lot so in that term zma didn't add you a that of value what about this one uh gr is often really good because these are PE so even in my college the people who gave this are people who are doing research and people who are doing great research at the top us colleges right what kind of research so this is either research in computational biology for example or you go very deep into one specific part of quantum physics for example so there are very specific things and the demand of these people are is crazy because you are experts right probably experts which specialized experts yes probably more specialization than an AI has so in that terms the demand of these people are increasing a lot got it we have two more left there's nid okay which is uh design okay why do you think this flows unfortunately I'll put it at C okay finally we have a c okay I'm not from nid I was just crying for the nid people watching this uh so I think like design is a huge field uh like I think the demand of UI is a lot yeah the problem is that an ID has two things you can get into an ID for so you can you can get into an N ID for probably growing into the code design Fields yeah so for example textile design or for example there's a lot of other designs industrial design and stuff right or you can go for uiux the thing is uiux design pays more right now so a lot of people get into nid for that and I don't think that's a good investment because I was reading a lot about it I didn't find that nids have a great placement record in that terms and secondly in uiux right as a whole also like if you compare it from that perspective and the second thing which happens is that in uiux design for example when I am hiring for that you portfolio matters a lot more yeah you don't care about the degree so for example in nid or a ni will probably score them one bonus point out of 100 which a good thing that okay they have studied this for the last four years but at the end of the day if you are someone from an i example who has done UI design I probably still prefer them more because they understand Tech products and they understand them more so again this is a bias perspective from a tech product perspective if you want to go into score design I unfortunately find that there's a very limited number of people who really care about that I feel like uiu design you can learn in 5 six months by yourself at least the basics right to the point where nid puts you out at 3 or 4 years again there's nothing against nid I think design is very dependent on the person's taste right right so if you have the taste then you can get it I'll give an example the designer we the only full-time designer we have at stimler is actually a dentist ear designer they have zero background in studying design assets a lot of the designers we hire are exactly like that they were doing something completely totally different it's more about the taste as you say so if they have a taste in design they can learn design very soon and they can create a solid portfolio and a solid design portfolio especially put in public I think that's worth much much more than a degree so nothing against an idea just feel that from a UI uxn perspective it's not worth it uh and what kind of jobs do at least the first you said there two sections right one is the textile for folks and things like that fashion and all that how much money do they make so they are less than your uh use well engineering so this is 70 80k a month yeah close to that probably even slightly lower on that if you take an average perspective there's a growth POS potential there so if you like open qua and you search for an ID placements you'll find a lot of people who probably started their career at 20K or 30k and they have grown over the years to two lakhs or three lakhs I find that growth scale to be very lower or the curve to much slower compared to an engineering degree or a tech job for example so if you want to go to uiuj probably get into a tech college and work on that because if you have a tech skill plus a uiuj skill I think that's much more valuable than a degree plus a skill that so the last one we have the NDA what does the NDA stand for so it stands for a National Defense Academy and you need to give this exam in your class 12th or before the end of class 12th to be able to get into either of Army Navy or Air Force so of course like probably the top of the ladder when it comes to like serving for the country and stuff and I also feel that it's so the ndx is very difficult by the way but I was reading about it I think that probably from a if someone asks if a junior and one of my siblings actually wants to be for IND and I think it's a good job in that terms because not a lot of people in class 11 12 level are very serious about it right so you hav't Ben so but the number of seats are also very low right so the reason I won't put it in an a for example is that NDA hardly has 300 400 seats right and you still have a lck of people appearing that exam so the exam competition is very tough but if you really care about this exam right if you want if you go deeper into NDA preparation as such the subjects in here is also again maths and English so that's a common part across a lot of these exams so so ultimately I can the what I can see is that it's mostly math and English yes and math sure you're either you know you've practiced it since grade four grade five and you've gotten good at it over the years or you g to tution for it and solved lots of problems or it's English which is learned best conversation right like I've never seen anyone read a book on English and just get good it's more like you do it again and again and again until you get really good interesting and uh the one thing about NDA is that GK is also involved in here okay so you so again that puts you slightly on an Advantage same with UPC right yeah if you're preparing for an NDA versus if you're preparing for an i and still giving NDA so that put in a slight of advantage and the pay scale is great so so uh basically if you clear NDA you would go into a three three years process training and then you would get into a uh left role in an Air Force or Army and the pay skill is pretty good I think it's over one lakh you plus all the perks plus all the perks Plus do seem like they have lots of perks both on the B level but they come more with perks than actual cash yes uh the thing is that upsc has much more competition and he has uh and the number of seats are similar got it this was exhaustive it was long I learned so much I understand ultimately it boils down to English and math if you do English and math well you can do all of this uh and I think this is this is very useful to see the scope of you know how everything goes you've added lots of nuance and color both on the side as a student if you few years ago now running an app that has many of these people come and to prepare for it thank you so much for this is there anything you want to leave the audience with especially somebody looking at you know entrance exams so I think like you would be either falling into two parts if you are someone who is very passionate about one of these things please go towards that no matter like what I say today about Iz being the top thing if you're passionate about need for example or passionate about even NDA you have a much much better chance to do this while going into the I everyone else hates it everyone doing it for a job yes that's the that will put you out of a league but if you have zero clue don't go for something T because you probably won't be able to generate enough passion or interest in it to sign out at the top and I think being at the top in any field is much much better than being at an a in a field so that's what I feel I want to ask you one question about your own app about stimula there's a lot of competition there's a bunch of AI apps that will now say Hey you know allow me to do a conversational agent teach me English give me you know feedback and all that how do you I'm sure you want become the best right how do you know you're doing well and what's the plan for the future for you so I think like from day one when we started we knew that this is a global problem this is a large scale problem so there would be competition if not today maybe when the tech is mainstream there would be competition so our Focus always has been staying one layer ahead specifically and building the best product globally so if you're competing with someone building an app in us we have to make sure that the product is better and for that AI is of course the thing which we have been investing a lot in so for example last year we won the Google Play's best AI app award on play store which is basically that's major yes that was the first year where our app was live and it tells us that in terms of AI specifically we are doing among the best work in India and we want to top it up right in the next year we probably want to win this award in 10 different countries right so that's the number one thing number two thing we are doing is that we are investing a lot in AI architecture right so because a lot of our work does with raw audio so what we are trying to do is can we build an architecture which is very specific to us which we can own because that eventually gives you for take advantage if not for perpetuity at least for the next two to three years so that is something we investing in we are setting up a long-term AI team at an early stage itself and that's the basic idea I think the only way to win from competition is have the best product if you have the best product globally and you're able to figure out distribution which is a key thing of course so if you have the combination of these two I think you can just win so that's the philosophy lovely I mean it's your 2223 hearing you walk in with so much Enlightenment knowing these spaces so well knowing your apps so well it's very inspiring to see thank you so much for joining us and hopefully the audience likes it as well that's it for me that's it for aay make sure you like subscribe comment you know the drill bye"}

{"video_id": "7jUdle3zMiE", "title": "This Physics Lesson Is The Secret To Success", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jUdle3zMiE", "transcript": "call AQ and 6 [Music] [Music] Freeze Frame now this video is not about cars but I need to use these cars to teach you a physics lesson this car in front is doing a great service for the one behind it this car is creating a slipstream for this one it's a concept from aerodynamics but we need a better set to explain this for for [Music] you now the intro of this video was made using the Intel Core Ultra laptops more on that later all right back to the garage so I was playing this driving simulator game on my PlayStation recently called Grand Turismo 7 and there's this concept in the game which because it's sold as a realistic driving simulator also exists in the real world with cars that concept is called a slipstream in the world of driving a slipstream is defined as the partial vacuum created behind a moving vehicle often used by other vehicles to help accelerate them in aerodynamics it's called drafting where one object takes advantage of another object in front of it to exploit the lead object slipstream and thus reduce the overall effect of drag drag is wind resistance at really high speeds as in car racing or even cycling using somebody else's slipstream somebody else going in front of you that you're sitting behind can significantly reduce the driver behinds average energy expenditure and can even slightly reduce the energy expenditure of the vehicle in front basically the driver in front punches a hole through the air and reduces drag and pressure for the person behind in fact there was a cyclist called guy Martin who he demonstrated slipstreaming aerodynamics by cycling behind a truck to achieve speeds of over 180 kmph think about how fast that is on a damn bicycle now why am I telling you all this because if there's one thing I've learned over a decade of building companies and projects and failing at Several of them with few successes here and there is that ultimately almost all success I've seen in the real world either for myself or my study of others comes from slipstreaming on social media it can be tempting to think that success comes from extreme hard work or some guy fighting All Odds or the myth of that Lan genius if hard work was the only thing that mattered then the person doing manual labor should be making the most amount of money that's why in my experience most success comes from the slipstream and it works exactly like it works with cars basically almost every company or individual you know who became successful either became successful because their chosen industry itself started small and became big over time or because they played right behind someone else moving fast with momentum take the example of Instagram in 2007 the iPhone was launched and we are calling it iPhone and this new phone was seeing crazy momentum it had created a slipstream for anyone who wanted to play on top of its App Store Instagram was one of those apps smartphones with cameras were already a thing in 2010 and that's even when the word selfie became popular back then photos including selfies were often saved to the phone's gallery and it was not necessarily shared right away what Instagram did was enable sharing with a cute marketing play called filters but their crazy growth was driven by a surge in demand for the iPhone it's the exact same scenario with several podcasting content creators in India how much of their success was predicated on geod dropping data costs and them just coasting on the slipstream created by being early right behind the Geo wave like just look at this graph anyone sitting on this graph would have seen crazy growth as long as the market wanted that growth this graph also birthed many new unicorns who were standing right behind that car waiting for the wave to happen I mean Deep dive into the consumption stats from 110 CR GB in 2016 to 8,600 CR GB in 2022 it works so proportionally that a content creator having let's say a total views of 100K people in 2016 and continuing to do his or her job would get several times bigger Just Because the Internet consumer base got several times bigger without putting any additional effort they were just doing their thing the industry got bigger and they succeeded as a result of it and slipstreams are so synergistic that how much of a creator success is because of YouTube's growth which is because YouTube used Android Slipstream by coming packaged in the operating system and how much of that Android OS growth was because of the growth of user demand for phones it's all slipstreams through and through let's take another famous example of zeroda look at this nitin Kut tweet that says that they were in the right place at the right time when Adar UPI and digilocker took off their platform which had been around for a while accelerated hard because of the slip stream created actually one of the economic activities that the government needs to do is create some of these slipstreams for others especially for private companies you've seen the same thing with a lot of the UPI apps as well but slip streaming isn't just limited to Industries and markets changing it can also be with other human beings I had been creating content for 7 to 8 years why did I accelerate this year how much of this was related to me slip streaming on tanas momentum because I worked like a dog for almost a decade why this year why not any other year it was it was also because AI really took off I have a post from 2018 on my Facebook about open a when absolutely nobody cared one of my earliest posts on Instagram was about a robotic arm that openi was working on all the way back then but covering them back then didn't matter but somehow it matters now why it's the slipstream I was early and the car told me because I was in the right place right time and it takes a lot of humility to admit that but all of the slipstreaming still requires work and being in the right place at the wrong time for years take another extreme example which doesn't actually require much work being an investor it's the most pure form of slipstreaming in the investor World they describe slipstreaming in the form of headwinds and Tailwinds but their only job is to catch the right fast-moving car punching a hole through the air you could argue it's a hard job to figure out which car to stand behind because there's so many cars and most of those cars are not going anywhere so there's still work being put in to figure out which car to sit behind but the main problem with slipstreaming is frankly that most people catch the wrong slipstream or catch it too late you need to catch a car when it is still slow accelerating fast and before other people have got onto it something moving with high acceleration rather than something moving with high absolute speed there's a difference between a car currently moving slow but accelerating fast versus a car moving fast but slowing down you need to catch the first one but it can sometimes be scary to switch to a new field or a new new industry when it's too small like VFX or game development these are all small Industries what if it doesn't work what if it fails and my personal case what if I'm actually too early I've actually built a lot of software and companies over the decade and the number one cause of failure on postmortem of some of them was trying to do things too early before there was a slipstream created the problem with this is sometimes the car can come and hit you from behind and that can lead to an accident for example working on things like inverse kinematics in unreal Engine 5 years ago was the metaverse even a thing back then was there consumer or investor demand back then not as much a lot of ml Engineers have this problem now of being a bit early and getting hit from behind with llms a lot of the old ways of doing things in machine learning had changed Amazon even laid off a bunch of people from the Alexa team after chat GPD came out because there was a new paradigm a new way of doing things right was filled with job Cuts in the ml division after llms became a thing so some sometimes being too early can be as bad as being too late remember Google Glass same issue being too early is actually as bad a problem as being behind don't complain about video editors or content creators who are suddenly doing well because they're in the right time right place after Geo one more thing about slipstreams they can stop the car in front of you can hit the brakes and that causes accidents behind it happened to me with my last company in the pandemic when the pandemic came it was this inflection point where a slipstream was possible we had some success with the community on Discord s and we built out our own Community app but when the pandemic just disappeared so did the slipstream people went back to the old way of doing things a lot of people on social media wonder why I have high loyalty from my audience no it's not because of the content I create today check out this tweet and read the comments too that app was my last company Avalon today if you go to a good startup in India a lot of people who worked there were people from the Avalon app or the Avalon Community what we accidentally did and we were still young and learning but the key thing here was that that slipstream may have started with me I didn't know what I was doing I was just trying something but it got stronger because of the community itself every person who became successful or got a job or started a company created a slipstream for the next person and that became powerful this is actually a physics concept that drivers in Motorsport take advantage of actually in races there's usually a big cluster of riders grouping or clumping together in what's called a palatin slipstreaming behind one another airbone objects like birds do something similar called Vortex surface where they create a vshape to take advantage of each other's momentum if one girl gets a job then she tells the company hey you should also talk to this other person from the community and so on and so forth so it's almost like they're riding that same vshape with each other formation is better than going alone but it's still very important that the formation is a slipstream some Market that's growing and that you are early but correct or you will crash and by definition if a car is already going really fast it's probably too late to slipstream behind it but very recently I discovered a new kind of slipstream I can generate we actually spend a lot of our time hacking and trying new technology experiments especially in the world of content most of the time it fails to us Hardware blockchain robotics arvr VFX it doesn't matter if it's an interesting technology we'll try experiments but when it works I tend to make content about it combine that with my newfound access to early technology and I'm able to show you a lot of what is coming a lot of people create content to make money or whatever but I actually use my distribution like a Visa everyone in the offline world can tell you that anyone who knows me if I can get in anywhere I can tell you about things before it happens for example I was the second Creator slm media person in the entire country of India to try Google starine a secretive project that hopes to replace meetings entirely using cameras and light field displays and if it works it's very valuable information for you the word is called Alpha that you can take advantage of so the information and access I have today has sort of started becoming a slip stream as long as I can make videos about it same with the meta R bands after using it for a while I can tell that it's going to become some new type of slipstream maybe meta a bands won't be the specific product that gets big but they will spark the market they will Kickstart it I do want to mention that over the last decade I've also Gotten Good at recognizing what slipstreams aren't there yet like virtual reality if you've been following me for 78 years you know I've been using VR since forever but user adoption for VR isn't that strong yet it has an effect where people buy it but but don't use it every day the car is not moving fast enough yet for you to tow along but at least for us it is good to keep building and standing in tow in case everything accelerates and you can smartly build games now which are adjacent to getting started doing full VR because the same underlying engines will be used to build VR experiences unreal and unity same skill slightly different application and lastly also remember that sometimes I can be wrong generally I try not to be and I'm trying to be more measured with my words and ideas these days because I know how many people need some new slipstream instead of standing in the traffic jam that is the react developer job and remember that as I get older my thoughts and ideas and even experience are getting sharper I'm gaining wisdom over the years which is hopefully useful to many of you I've made many mistakes in the past that I'm embarrassed by but I've been prudent enough to learn from them I know which cars you'll follow that will just end up crashing but if I do make mistakes please have the wisdom to forgive me remember humans make mistakes and I'm still human at least for now so today I'm super excited to take you behind the scenes of our CGI intro creation we managed to pull off something pretty incredible a highquality CGI sequence created entirely on laptops but more on that game-changing Hardware later first let me walk you through our process we kicked things off using stable diffusion for our concept art this AI workflow helped us rapidly generate and iterate on visual ideas for the intro giving us a solid foundation to build upon next we move to blender here we composed the 3D envir enironment based on our stable diffusion Concepts and created those Dynamic camera movements you see in the intro after exporting from blender we took our footage into premere we applied lots and did a basic color grade establishing the overall color palette and mood then it was over to Adobe After Effects for a more detailed color grade we used the magic bullet plugin which was crucial in achieving the specific visual style we were after now you might be wondering how we managed to handle this complex workflow without a massive render Farm or high-end workstations well that's where things get interesting the secret behind this entire production was the Intel Core Ultra powerered laptops we used these aren't your average laptops they're what we call AI PCS and the key difference is that they're equipped with a neural Processing Unit or npu this specialized chip is a GameChanger for AI related tasks because of optimized workload distribution where the npu complements the functions of the CPU and GPU ensuring that no single processor gets overwhelmed it can handle sustained heavily used AI workloads at low power allowing the CPU and GPU to focus on more ensive tasks like 3D rendering in blender or video processing in premere Pro hence this overall efficiency meant we could try out more ideas and refine our work faster than ever before what's even more exciting is that Intel has collaborated with over 100 independent software vendors isvs like Adobe and many others to optimize these applications for AIP PCS this collaboration ensures that you get the best possible experience letting you focus on what matters creating better content and this is how this intelligent division of labor allowed us to create this highquality CGI intro without being tied to a massive workstation it's opening up new possibilities for creators and for those of you

out the par luckily the first game that we built which was Ludo star and it went viral in Pakistan blocking more than 10 million in Revenue where you felt like oh we have made it as a gaming studio when we were I think 2017 or 18 and we saw a revenue of 100 crores and that was too big for us ultimately it's all psychology no this is all like monetization models really flow from the psychology and the behavior of people but how much would it cost if I was building like a simple RPG for pubg I think 100 million also that's about 800 crores ,000 downloads in us can give you like $10,000 also a month even more than that I mean $20,000 maybe Subway Surfer has been there in the market for the last 13 years that company has been sold to minp recently for 100 million it should have been a much bigger game considering how much of the world's attention is captured gen impact is not an Indian game but apparently he doing millions of dollars on the Indian Play Store right and I was so surprised with gensin impact doing so well because I'm like wait what ladies and gentlemen welcome to another episode of tier list today I have a very special guest offer from gameberry and you know I have a lot to say about gameberry but first I'll tell you what we're reviewing what we're rating today is the different type of gaming genres more as a game developer so if you're a game developer interested in making games you want to know you want to know okay if I build an arcade game in India how much money can I make if I build a game like Among Us in India how much money can I make what is the scope in it what is the competition you want to know all of that you're probably a developer and you're interested in some of this meaty information now I've played with a few games before I've made some games before usually short demos we made overpower the card game we made Mumbai make Hada but I've never made mobile games at scale so I thought if I want to do this video I need to get somebody who has made games at massive scale so today I have somebody who's done that you run gameberry it's done this year I think over you'll do over 500 crores in Revenue you've been around since 2017 before we begin I want to know your story I think they definitely want to know your story and then we'll get through uh each of these placards thanks vun thanks uh for having me here pleasure to be with you uh and sharing the same stage in a way um so my story I I feel it begins with um in 2010 uh second year of my college uh when when I feel at I I felt more me back then and I came across these web technologies that was happening at that time Facebook came into picture or could had just gone back then uh and when I looked at Facebook I started feeling that this is something that I could do and it's very much possible to build something like this so I started learning those Technologies trying to build something that I felt could be very interesting for people and all the next three years of my college went trying to build multiple things I it was every time a six month cycle where I was trying to build something and by the end of six months I realized this not going to work out so I went back started something else and then went back and kept doing that for like six seven times and then the corporate life started I went moved to capillary as a software engineer but the same behavior the same Instinct of building something never went away uh so I me and my co-founder we kept having discussion all the time what do we want to build next what do we want to build next and we kept trying multiple things uh from 200 14 uh when we in 2014 I decided I would leave my job and do this full-time where I would like to build something for people and that particular point of time uh it was difficult for me to think what do I do from here uh but then College seniors give you a lot of confidence that uh you can do something like this you can go out raise funds and get something started and it felt like a doable thing so I thought okay let let's do this so we moved out and two two days is into it the idea that we were thinking we felt like this is not going to work out we were out there in the market it was vulnerable condition where you start to feel that whatever you thought is not going to work out uh so but then we put put oursel back um and we started working on this idea where we were delivering an ingredient box of whatever you wanted to cook and we called it half teaspoon um and and the orders came from a lot of places belandur rsr here and there and we felt that this is going going to work out this is interesting so we started talking to a lot of VC's and VC got interested that this is something in different in India somebody was trying to do uh fast forward 6 months it was not working out we were getting order but we're not getting repeated orders and that year by the end we started realizing that we did not started uh we did not move out of our jobs because we wanted to do this because we started to becoming what the VCS wanted for us to become yeah I think that was a ship fundamental shift in the mindset back then uh and then uh and and we had plenty of time back then uh because because you you were not getting orders and U and there was nothing to do as such until that point so I started playing a lot of games we had new mobile tablet we started playing a lot of games and when I looked at the mobile or the games that we were playing uh it occurred to me that this is something that we can build and it's not so difficult so I started a game called Rocket Romeo in January 2015 buil it it 2 months posted out put it out on Google Play uh and saw people playing that game um and then I realized this is something that I really wanted to do because art uh Design Technology was coming into one pck place uh you had an empty canvas you could do anything you wanted to do uh and with that canvas you could go out to the users and users would love it if you have created something unique about it I think that's the place where I got into gaming and I felt like this is a place where I would like to belong for years uh and I decided okay let me spend some time in a proper professional setup of a gaming company so I did that and then eventually decided I want to start a gaming studio so that was my story about what was your first hit what was the first game that really blew it out the park luckily the first game that we built which was Ludo star uh it went viral it went viral yes uh within 6 months we at the beginning we felt uh that people in uh in India were installing Ludo games they wanted to play Ludo game but they were not getting what they should be getting the social experience was not enriching uh so we thought that we could build a great Ludo game uh and that's where we started uh and six months down the line that resonated with the audience people started playing it people started calling other folks to play there with them uh and it went viral in Pakistan and then it went viral in Saudi Arabia Kuwait Oman and we were all over the place we were 2 3 million da by the end of that da for the audiences daily active users we were already 2 to 3 million daily active users that year uh and we were clocking more than 10 million in Revenue that the first year of our uh Foundation you know one Insight I picked up from this which I pick up from a lot of Founders talking to them is especially till they get that first hit they've tried a lot of stuff you did food delivery you did you worked at a company you tried a game then went back to a company came back it seems like a very messy path lots of pivots till that one thing kicked off I've seen this so many times this is a thing that audience doesn't really get that actually to get to one place that's successful you need to try a lot of different things and it looks very messy and chaotic throughout uh so it's very interesting hearing that story again so if you are thinking oh you're working on something it's not working out today especially as an entrepreneur because I think in a job it's slightly different as an entrepreneur it's all you're fully dependent on the market in a job you're fully dependent on your boss but it's predictable you are given expectations on day one but with the market you have no idea what the market wants and sometimes you could build something thinking this will work and the market will be like no and sometimes you build a loo game and then 6 months later it's like it goes wildfire in a you know in in Pakistan right so some of these things in life are kind of unpredictable so very very interesting to hear this story uh we'll get into more of it as we go through these but I'll tell you what we have today I'll tell you our usual format so today I have a bunch of uh formats to make games genes right which we'll talk about Mobile gaming mostly but I'm sure the same genes exist in PC so hopefully you can give us insights you've built these as scale I know you've built many different games so you know which games uh have worked well which games have made money the insights in the game like an Among Us game what are the challenges you know all of it so hopefully you can demystify us for it we will rank these based on how much money is there and whether it's a good scope for a game developer today to build this game and to build this type of game right so this is what we're going to do and uh these are your opinions uh it is okay for you to feel a certain way it's okay if the audience disagree that's all it's it's completely comfortable on our channel so without much further Ado let's take up the first game we have arcade games right like Subway Surfers uh Mob control where do you think this goes do you have any insights on arcade games yes um I would rate arcade C okay uh you you'll have to take off the strip there sorry for all your arcade game Builders uh you have a pessimist in the house if you ask me uh I feel arcade games are natural to go because the first game that I was talking about myself was rocket Romeo it's an arcade game uh very simple to play very highly inspired by the arcade machines that were there uh in the early times um but on the other hand with mobile being a very different form factor yeah uh I feel as an instinct because of our childhood we go towards our kid but mobile has a different form factor and the the way you can interact with mobile is way way different than arcades so arcades are those machines right with the tap t uh and mobile form factor gives you a lot more in-depth engagement compared to that because you had few controls at hand uh so the form factor is not suitable for these kind of games which is why the monetization also not necessarily works really well but the Nostalgia kicks in in this particular case which is why you'll get a lot of downloads in Subway Surfer there sub Subway Surfer has been there in the market for the last 13 years it still gets high amount of downloads more than 5 million I think in a month but even then they do not make a lot of money they have been that company has been sold to mini clip recently for 100 million mini clip still exists Min clip exits yeah so they got sold to mini clip at 100 million I think that's the number it should have been a much bigger game considering how much of the world's attention captured but think about it even then the cost of that game was 100 million itself just so the reason for that is it the Nostalgia brings in a lot of audience why did it cost 100 Milli to make Subway suffers no 100 million to buy surway surer okay okay rather than uh building and and they bought it because they wanted that amount of downloads that are coming to uh to service suffer organically uh and all these downloads are organic for that game again arid brings organic downloads but not money but not money very interesting so if I was a junior developer and I was building an arcade game what kind of expectation should I have should I just go in there saying I'll build the game and then hopefully I'll get downloads and then I'll run ads like let's say if I if I had a game and I got 100,000 downloads on arcade games and I started running ads that's the main way to monetize right how much do you think I would make regarding arcades uh I think the function of Revenue would come from geography that is it it is hitting say India uh if it is hitting hitting India and you were getting 10 million downloads a month let's say 100,000 downloads 100,000 download would give you nothing literally like not even $100 a day uh if from ads that's quite sad yes so you need to get to 10 million downloads as an arcade game to even make any money interesting especially because your geography is in India uh there is a sense of nostalgia that will kick in with arcade games uh but not a new Market game will have that Nostalgia but if I got the same let's say 100,000 downloads in the US then then it will be drastically different 100,000 downloads in us can give you like $110,000 also a month okay so even more than that I mean $20,000 maybe wow Revenue so the geography really matters so if you're building an arcade game if there's somebody building an arcade game in the Indian setting it's say Gully some something Gully you're saying even though that sounds like a very Noble idea it might not make you so much money it's better to hit like a like a global concept very interesting let's go through the next one the next format is the puzzle game right so we have things like Royal match Candy Crush I love playing puzzle games especially when I'm stressed I'm just like you know I quickly open my phone and play some puzzle games especially when I was younger nowadays it's different nowadays when I play games I play a game called DOTA that gives me even more stress right so it has defeated the purpose of what it's supposed to do but I know my mom plays a lot of candy crush and you know other puzzle games to to relieve stress is there a big market for this yeah puzzle games are like huge where would this I would put put it as a uh not putting I would like to put it as s but the amount of competition because of the amount of money this category has okay uh it makes it extremely difficult to be a s because then the competition is very high any big Studio would uh would like to be in a puzzle category uh all these games Royal match Candy Crush they are like a billion dollar a year business uh Royal match has just surpassed Candy Crush they they do around 2 billion a year wow uh which is massive uh so because of that reason I would not rate it as uh keep it a can you tell me why puzzle games make so much more money than arcades it's it's blowing my head like I would assume that an arcade game someone can play casually theoretically should make more money than a puzzle game this is actually news to me and it's probably news to the audience as well so how I think monetization in gaming how it works is uh I AP will always be heavier than ads what is I AP Ina in app purchases will always be heavier than ads uh because at the end ads are shown to the user because you want to move them to a game which has an IEP at it so you're saying you might have multiple games and your first game will have ads to the second game and the second game will have some inapp purchase where you buy some different kind of ball or this or that right what are the what are people spending on in Candy Crush in Royal match in Royal match they are the whole business is around replaying a level the better you convince a player to replay a level without moving out of the game the better your monetization will be so the mechanics convinces them that this is achievable by them and if it is achievable it's their mistake that they're not able to CL across this level so they guil trip you into buying so you feel okay it is just this level where I'm paying but not the rest of the levels which technically happens I mean you tend to so you fail a level and it says start all over again unless you pay you get to play this level again so you're saying that's the asset being sold I would assume it's some jewelry or something like that no it is it is this it's a life it's a chance you want to cross that level you don't want to even lives for that matters do not monetize so well now because people don't want to say that you told me that you can play five chances that is why I have tried five times time times and if I want more chances you have have to pay people don't like that people likes that okay I have failed at it let me do let me take this help so that I can cross it the mindset is slightly different it's a hint mind yes it's a hint hint mindset exactly so when that kind of mechanics comes into a picture where people are convinced that this is a good level where I want to cross with that hint they will monetize in arid does does not does not happen there is a lot of skill at play in arid because you are you're relying on dexterity over there you can't play around with uh the game itself which is why the monetization goes up here competition also goes up here uh and most of the gaming companies I think they want a pie of this I didn't know this was worth billions of dollars a year in Revenue that's so much bigger than you know even the subway surface of the world this is like this is news to me this is something I learned while doing this conversation and that's why this format is so useful right because when you ask people to rank someone who's an expert in the industry who does it for living who's at scale and you ask them to rank then you learn the nuances you learn oh that okay that makes a lot of sense so I feel like this is very useful to everyone me and I'm sure everyone Watching Next let's go to the format that I think uh you know a lot of entrepreneurs in India have a problem with the casino format Monopoly go Bingo yeah is Monopoly go a casino Casino format it is a social casino game it draws from the slot mechanics uh but it's lot more casual and social in nature uh I would rate Casino as B uh the reason being for me casino is more classic in nature okay the mechanics that we have seen slot machines Bingo Tula for India um tinpati for that matter all these mechanics or the would poker also fall under poker poker is casino this I assume would be much bigger no in terms of CAS it is big in terms of cash but because it is so classic your classic players early players in this category would be dominating all the time so so poker by Zinga or poker by platica has been there for the last 12 years you can't put enough of a spin on poker you're saying to build a new game like in arcade if you have Subway Surfers you can you can make the same guy with a hat and call a temple run in a temple but you can't do that with Casino you can't say Teti but on a different table because it's not enough of a differentiator next let's go through simulator so Roblox talking town I assume there are lots of different you know simulators can you give us some examples of simulators doing well and can you also rank I would rate simulators as s really yeah not because uh it makes a lot of money but because I feel personally that there is lot of opportunity in simulators especially if you look at India you'll see a lot of truck simulator Bus Simulator Indian Railway simulator being downloaded the audience is always looking for playing around with something which is more real in nature and they can experience you would like to be a uh pilot in a Indian Railway uh bogey you would like to drive that I want to tell you a very interesting anecdote I once had an employee this was many years ago who used to play this VR game called job simulator he used to skip work to play a VR simulator called VR game called job simulator and I was like what is wrong with you you can simulate the job here if you want to but he's like no I like going back home and doing a job in the simulator and doing the tasks there it gives me a sense of calm here it's little a little bit more stressful understandable but I didn't know Simulator games were that big till every day I open Steam sometimes and I'll see goat simulators you know truck simulator farming simulator police station simulator like and I was like wait what is wrong with people like you can just have the job in real life and do it but people like no no I want to do it from my couch sitting and playing it so very surprising to see uh you know this I think you're talking about it as an S because you can simulate everything and so the competition is low the competition is low the demand is high the only factor which might be anti for this category would be the monetization is not very very clear so you might have to innovate around it like can you give me an example uh take example of truck simulators they don't monetize so well they have very high engagement but how do you monetize that you would like to sell more trucks but that's not very like I will not spend money on buying different type of trucks as such unless it actually makes a lot of difference in the gamepl or the experience that I have interesting so that is why the monetization goes low over here so we need I think the developers need to innovate and think about it uh and I feel Innovation should always be a will always be a driver in success for you do you have any Simulator games no we don't have I'll give you an example for that when we started Ludo uh at that at that time none of the Ludo games monetized through I AP uh but our business is 0% I AP driven and anybody who is playing a Ludo game would feel monetization in Ludo is not possible so what we did differently from everybody else in the market was we incorporated this mechanics called roll uh so once you roll a dice we allow you to re reroll so if it's a bad roll and you don't like where you've gotten you spend some money and you reroll can you do that in multiplayer or only indiv in multiplayer as well because the opponent also has that ability of rrolling so everyone rrolling all the time yes everybody's rolling it's fair from that perspective and you can choose you have a little sense of control over life from that perspective which is missing generally I mean you that's what you want from a game actually you want that sense of control I think that is why that person that you talked about in job simulator I feel that person can control a lot of things and be excited about it uh the external factors are not making the job unsatisfactory ultimately it's all psychology no yes this is all like monetization models really flow from the psychology and the behavior of people it's not feature consi it's like how does a human brain think and does the human brain want a roll or does it want sense of control it's more that that that's dictating how much money comes into these industries interesting and one question to ask you right considering that you've made some of these games and you got to scale and you were talking about your iip purchases what is there a point in all of this where you felt like oh we have made it as a gaming studio what Revenue was that and when we when we were I think 2017 or 18 we were doing more than 10 million 12 million we were feeling that that's 100 cres you yeah yeah that was big enough I think we were we were earning what uh 20 lakhs a month sorry 20 lakhs a year as when you were in a job yeah and we saw a revenue of 100 crores and that was too big for us and we had never imagined because the circle that we had everybody had a VC funding we are not boot we are not VC funded we are bootstrapped and for a company to make 100 cres nobody had heard of it so we were making 100 CR and we felt we were big enough until unless people said you have a great opportunity at hand you can make this bigger and bigger why are we restricting ourselves with that 100 crores and being satisfied about it and that's the point I think that shifted fundamentally our mindset it started we started poking ourselves where are we going wrong what could we do better from here because there were examples of gaming company across the world doing even better than that and did Google Play say hey look at this other company they've scaled this much you should yeah they had plenty of options I mean they can draw parallels uh from let's say uh what is working out in us how Saudi Arabia might look at us differently compared to how we look at it but you tend to miss those points at times so I think that an external person like Google Play coming out from outside helped us a lot to miss those blind spots and and since then that was how many years ago three four years ago that was three four years since then you've gone from 100 CR to 500 crores nice nice it's very strange to you know hear things like well you were already doing well but you had an a catalyst movie 5x bigger right that's it's a at any stage in life there could be a catalyst now where is the dream from here now that you have 500 crores what's the next Catalyst where do you think you'll go from here now I think the mindset mindset for us has shifted drastically for us now uh the ambition is to be that 5,000 CR business uh and we feel we can achieve that because we have started learning in a very different way now earlier we were looking at it and saying this could be big this is this looks big enough but after hiring smart folks in in our team we start they are starting to tell us that noar this is 5,000 crores not just 500 crores to what we are doing today and they'll give you multiple reasons of why it can happen and then you can okay say yeah I want to invest in this I want to spend more time in it make more teams around it and it helps a lot and I feel very confident about the fact that we'll be hitting 5,000 cror somewhere down the line for sure interesting let's go back let's take the next format next is RPG you know IID read somewhere about genion impact genion impact is not an Indian game but apparently is doing millions of dollars in the Indian Play Store right which and I so surprised with gensin impact doing so well because I'm like wait what yeah it's an RPG it's and it's not an Indian RPG so why is it doing so well and why is it making so like what are people spending on in India on this game so a I'd like you to rank it yeah I would rate RPG games as uh a because of the amount of opportunity it has but also because of the difficulty in making an RPG game successful uh it has people would like to play RPG games a lot uh um especially because of the narrative sense to it genion impact has that narrative sense you're getting into that open world you can do anything you want again the sense of control is in your hand uh you can play around with it uh so genine impact worked in India because of that particular fact in general the art was fabulous in general the the game was cross prom cross mobile plus cross crossplatform yeah uh you could play on mobile you could play on PC India generally has more mobile audience rather than PC audience uh but R RPG in general monetized really really well because somebody getting invested into an RPG can go deeper in pocket I AP games because it's a story yeah because of the story and the ability that you would like to gain so how RPG games monetized is you would go from level X to level 10x to 100x to 1,000x whatever you want to go you can potentially go there and the story of those games generally have the ability to make you go there which does not creates limitation for anybody to pay so a lot of monetization is actually the ability of the game for to ask the ability to ask the payer to go from0 to $1,000 in like a second if it can do it it can monetize more uh and we internally say a lot of time that IP plays VIP play so people who can pay a lot if they can pay huge amounts M then your game is going to monetize and that is why RPG games work so well they they monetize like crazy a person can spend $100,000 in just by the way RPG stands for role playing game and the minute there's a role playing game then there's a story so the one thing I've heard about RPGs though compared to all the other games is expensive to make right because you have to store you have to create character story what would it cost me in India today if I was building like a mobile RPG if you were building a genion impact I don't think we can build in in India right now uh especially because of the technology uh and mostly that the learning of getting it right I think it will take time for any Indian Studio to build that I think that the complexity is very high on the other hand you can build a lot more simpler 2D version RPG games which will also work in but how much would it cost if I was building like a simple RPG it should cost anywhere around 10 million to 20 million if you want so about 100 to two 100 to 160 crores let's say roughly yes that's very expensive for an RPG genion impact would be 10x of that so th000 crores they SP to build it yes oh my God that is an expense so you can't do it without VC funding very hard to do bootstrap interesting interesting next let's go to tabletop you technically have a tabletop game right Ludo is a tabletop game tic Taco Uno yeah where would you plant this I would put it at B okay but you have a game in this category why would you call it a b uh again very similar to casino uh tabletop generally will have very classic games which are present uh so if if there is a user coming for Ludo a variant of Ludo very unlikely that the person would like to play so very similar Behavior as so that's the reason you didn't go viral in India you went viral in a new market because Indian market was crowded you yeah Indian market was already playing a Ludo game uh Pakistan on the other was not playing a Ludo game so they had options of choosing between multiple Ludo game they chose Ludo star uh which is also uh that choice also came because of Google Play being really really good at uh publishing and allowing people to explore at at in Play store which creates a lot of organic downloads so tell me what is your number one Insight from making tabletop games because you have a lot of them right I feel in tabletop JRE generally the engagement is very very high there is lot of stickiness around the users so if somebody starts to spend in your game they will spend for next 10 years for sure which is a great LTV to have you just need to get them to spend once yes yes LTV stands for what is lifetime value of a user which means how much he totally he or she spends on you over the years and in this particular category tabletop generally most of the gaming companies don't have a monetization model which also means that there is could be an opportunity over here uh if you pick let's say uno uno is an IP of metal you can't build a Uno game but let's say you you are building something similar to Uno and you are able to monetize it then the likelihood of of that game sticking around with people is very very high because they will keep playing Uno and they'll see this as an Uno game or a card game which is very similar to Uno but if you can monetize it they'll stick around with it and they'll start to maybe forget a Uno as well next let's take on party so stumble guys Among Us you have an Among Us competitor what's it called we had uh traitor Labs was the name of the game we tried to build uh on the similar lines how you put this I would put this as uh a okay especially because this category is new uh this category is with Mobile coming into picture uh one of the and covid happening in 2020 people started socializing on young people started socializing on mobile a lot so you'll see stumble guys or among us being played by teenagers a lot which means your stream of audience which is going to come they are they have not been exposed to this category as such so this is all older people you're seeing puzzle Casino arcade they're older people they're like 30s 40s this is like 18 19 18 19 and I assume they have less money less money which is which is true which is why the monetization goes down in this category but they are crazy fans of it once they start to like it with their friends they just stick around with it and they come back to it again and again in traitor Labs as well I was seeing there was stream of teenagers have a group of 10 people they'll come back to the game they'll play if you do something wrong they'll email you that we are not able to do this we are not able to do that they'll be very enthusiastic about sharing their experiences also so this C they also stream a lot no they stream a lot uh uh even traiter Labs not being so big we were getting few YouTubers trying to stream that as well which was very interesting for us because we and then that guy was coming back and saying okay I want to uh I want to become big YouTuber from here based on traitor labs and we were super happy too why do you shut down the game uh the the biggest Gap that I saw in that particular category was even if we go big we were not able to see uh how would we beat among us as such uh we tried few modes which were very different we had a zombie mode which was very interesting which started working with people as well where there's a zombie and the zombie is creating everybody's zombie so the one person who's get who is not becoming a zombie actually wins the game and makes the non- zombie category win so that was a very interesting mode which people were liking but it was not appearing as engaging as what Among Us was doing so saying Among Us captured the brand for this category and it's very hard once somebody has completely captured a brand for all impostor or or team type games and the only way to win now is to do something like a stumble guys which is or Fall Guys which is different yeah but still a party game yeah and stumble guys for that matter I mean uh when you look at that game again it's it's not the depth of the game is not very huge it's the amount the yeah the people that you're playing with you're having fun with them it's like it's like us talking right you don't know what serend you will come you will fall I'll be like haha that's the novelty of the game not the game features itself right it's it's me looking at your reaction to me playing the game in real time and vice versa so imagine something like I pretty sure you would have seen the Nickelodeon uh shows Takeshi's Castle exactly something tak's Castle or there was one uh Legends of the Hidden Temple I think you would remember that for sure yeah it is nostalgic I mean imagine we used to imagine at when we looking at TV that I'm playing yes so that is the kind of game that this game offers because as a child you would like to be in that space where you're competing with somebody but not very uh not so not serious not very serious that's a great great way of putting it it's a party game it's a party game so I think that particular emotion for teenagers I think this C genre captures his really well and people can build more of this I I I think people are not building enough in this particular genre interesting next let's go to Sports FIFA cricket league I'm sure there are lots of cricket games do you have any sports games no we don't have we restrict ourselves to more tabletop and puzzle okay that's because that's your Forte yeah where would you put this though I would put sports games again over here not so much in monetization very classic in nature so the EA Sports Games will work much much better than you making a cricket knockoff yes yes so and and and the games that work out in the space generally give you that Sports Experience altogether uh very less number of sports games you'll see monetized really well uh some of the games that I can think of is FIFA monetizes well uh golf Clash monetizes really well these games monetize well but they have had hard time reaching that space because people like to play against sports game very casually you would like to knock six balls and then move on to some other game something like that so you're saying the retention time is lower yeah retention is also slightly lower but and they keep CH changing games they keep trying different different variants uh where they feel that their skill has kind of saturated also what do you monetize in this like you can't charge people for a new colored ball or a bat or whatever right like in FIFA I think the monetization is the game itself you buy the game right it's a paid game uh but I feel like if it was a free game it would be very hard for me to figure out what exactly I'd monetize in the game like even with most sports games right I feel like at least as a consumer as somebody who plays the games it's like I have no incentive to pay for anything and that's why all these games like everything even for a WWE which is not really a sports game but a WWE FIFA NBA you pay for the game first and then you play you know as much as you want you can do whatever you want in the game and even the unlocks like a buying the rock inside WWE it is still with in-game currency which you don't really pay for unless you want to but I I don't see anyone like paying for in-game currency just to unlock the rock they will rather grind the game out and then you know uh pay for it that's a bit of Indian mindset okay okay because in us uh you'll see a lot of people doing that just unlock just unlocking because they want to experience that particular player uh and in India what I've seen is microtransactions have kind of grown Over The Last 5 Years uh once you are convinced in one of the games and I'll give you my example itself U the first game that I can think of was I think homecapes which made me pay uh and the reason was I got inside that game so much that I felt now I need this to unlock the other stories or the content that I want to see it and I paid just 100 rupees for that but then something triggered in my mind and I was very now your wallet is opening yes yes so I became very comfortable playing in Clash of Clans and there are few cricket games that I've paid in uh I've paid like 20,000 rupees in one of the games uh Clash of Clans I would have spent 5,000 6,000 rupees uh so I think that opened up once I was triggered by one of the games uh so India generally is opening up to that uh you will see more and more games getting more and more I APS in India and people are starting to realize that as well uh you said IPS I APS in app purchase okay awesome next let's talk about Shooters so pubg and Call of Duty and all that of course pubg has the secondary element of being a battle royale I don't know let me just check if we have battle royals here it is the same yeah okay so I think we have uh Shooters like we'll call Battle Royale a subset of shooters very popular I see this these people streaming all the time but I don't know how it would be from a money perspective where would you put this again from money perspectives it is right there monetizing huge especially because of the vanity factor in it uh people like to show off when the other folks are watching you play because people are streaming or showing Clips they want to do that nice head shot they want to show a nice gun status so you buy a golden gun because there's status but isn't it very competitive it is very competitive uh but on the other hand because this is newer mobile mobiles have become more and more heavy in terms of ram which means the ability to do a lot of things have gone up uh for a small developer I think this is difficult to get into but for somebody uh who can invest a little more I think there are a lot of demand of different ways of playing Shooters pal world uh is a kind of Battle Royal but with Pokemon type animals creatur so there are lot of games that are coming out in a different different setting and there will be games coming out in very very different settings in the next five years four years where I think they will be F first person shooter yet uh yet being slightly different spin-off on with Pokemon or this or that so so so there's unlimited like simulators there's unlimited scope for variance but do you feel like people play shooters for a while and then stop playing and then move on or the stickiness there is very high stickiness with Shooters as well like people play heavily especially with again social component in it I think pubg free fire they have very strong social component so wherever you can go around with your friends I think it is lot more engaging it has some overlap with party games in a way it has some overlap with r RPG games in a way and it has some overlap with you know even Sports and arade to some extent right it feels like a sport you five team versus some other five team feel like War um is it expensive to make it is certainly very expensive as good as as good as like RPG that I was talking about so it cost you 100 crores in India to make like more than that more than that for pubg I think it will might cost 100 million also that's about 800 crores yeah but for uh let's say a smaller version of it probably you can do that and there will be lot of downloads people even download sniper 3D where there's a sniper with you and then you are shooting around yeah very single player is but but giving you that sniper experience so it's a very you can break it down to very small sub Jer of just being good at sniper which is why I've placed it up for uh small developer I think picking one of the niche is very important they can start with Niche big developers can obviously go big interesting so we have two more left next is strategy Clash of Clans Clash Royale I'm sure Age of Empires on the PC would also fit here where would you put this I would put them again on a uh should I put it sure okay a we'll put it here yeah okay so lot of money in strategy once you've got the game right I think there is chance of a lot of innovation as well uh how much do the big games make big games make again A Clash of Clans is certainly 1 billion a year and that they have been making it since last 10 years so if your strategy component is right in the game there is more replayability in the game when I say replayability it means can the player experience the same thing in a different strategy again and again again and again if that is present then your strategy is Right strategy mechanics is Right which will make the game stick around with audience longer and they are always looking for something new so from an audience Lookout perspective it is hot always uh that if say something new they would like to jump onto it the pocket is deep they can spend a lot of money because they would like like their army to be stronger and stronger uh and and which is why I've kind of uh rated at a nice if you had to choose between strategy and puzzle for a new developer in India to make which which would they choose I would choose puzzle uh especially because I feel strategies games uh technology is a lot more complicated than puzzle can you give me an example imagine Clash of Clans so if it if you're sending out your army uh you want to be sure that the Army has destroyed the base because the other the base of the base Bas is for the other players the players other base they'll complain if it's wrong yeah if it is mismatch it it is slightly off if you can if the player can hack the mobile then it's again going wrong so you want to be very very sure that the placement of elements were right which means the real time communication between server and the mobile should be absolutely spot on the multiplayer replic the multiplayer aspect of it makes it a lot more complicated whereas in puzzle uh that complexity is not present puzzle games are really one single player solo so the complexity goes Downs there is lot more ease in building it shipping features so I have a question here for your games what do you use we are multiplayer but our multiplayer is again lot less complex because no I mean like do you use Unity or unreal or we we for some games we use Unity for some games we use coco 2dx uh which is a C++ uh engine which is not so popular but very hardcore engine which were which we have we used in 2017 itself now we have moved on to Unity Unity for some of the games is it getting easier over time with all the abstractions if you want today an asset pack you can buy it this that in unity certainly game development is lot more easier uh uh Coco studx is a lot more tough it is open source um it's lot more raw in nature but I feel at your scale now you don't care whether something is raw or not right you would care more about ease of like you would use Unity because it's just easy to get the next game up and running and then if it really works you rebuild it again from scratch in a new way of doing things very interesting and how many employees do you have today we have 300 people how many of those are unity Engineers around 60 people mostly not Unity Engineers as such uh some would be Unity 10 12 uh but we generally categorize them as game developers and software Engineers uh not specifically Unity because we feel anybody who is good with uh coding or programming can figure can figure it out yeah it's it's it's this weird Trope on the internet where if you're good at coding then you're only good at react or you have a certain GitHub commit history or whatever people have not gotten used to it yet especially people who are straight out College they've not got used to it yet that software is very wide gaming definitely comes game development comes under software unreal Unity are sure you still write C or C+ plus but it's it's still very different from traditional engineering but if you are a good engineer in one place you can easily transfer over right you're an engineer so you've probably done you you built apps you you worked at Cap Gemini then you did games so there's very wide variance in what you can do as an individual well I have one last you know game category and that is racing racing I would it's very interesting actually because people love to race but the monetization again is very difficult over here why because again you just cannot give uh there's very less number of games that have been able to monetize it CSR 2 is one of the games I think they do's called CSR 2 uh they monetize around 70 million a year but that's the max I have heard about racing games that's not very good that's not very good yes uh that is especially because uh again you cannot play around with the mechanics of it you are going to race you cannot make it so unfair that I you are getting a Mercedes and I'm getting a sta Sumo you can't make that happen so to give all your players equal access very similar so probably the moneti will start to come in similar to Shooter where probably the skin of the car would matter or the the whole game could be a very story based game again it then it becomes like more like RPG meets racing in that particular case because then you're solo then in Solo you can like spend more money get better car and then you can defeat the villain that's that's a very different thing where would you plant this I would rate it B uh but I feel that there's a lot of interest in racing games in general people like to try doctor driving also to competitive racing uh like Horizon and then Forza and I spent a lot on racing games right right like more to buy the game and after that you know I'd like to grind and unlock it even though I can you're right it's an Indian mentality like I would not like to pay for a car I would like to grind and get it but yeah like solo games but I can understand like apart from the foras of the world and maybe two three top racing games I wouldn't try a new one cuz I need the best graphics I need the best you know features I there's no point trying a tier 2 or a tier three racing game because I'm like you know the best one will anyway have all of this it's all the same cars anyway right and Licensing the cars actually matters you know in EA Sports like Cricket you had all those fake names of those things in racing also I've seen some of that so very interesting to see this being ranked a b uh and very interesting to also hear that the best racing games only make like 70 mil right that's the top game you're saying on mobile making 7 mil I have one last question for you we're done with you know the tier list why do you choose to do mobile games over PC games I feel uh for me uh particularly when I was getting into gaming I felt I would like to do something where the results are a lot more faster I feel PC games uh the results are slower in nature you would like to build something for a it takes time to build those games uh people like very well polished games in Mobile the audience is a lot more casual in nature so you can get the result faster it's it's a Lean Startup mentality where you get things out fast and get and also like the play store has distribution like with a PC game you're going to probably Steam and then you still have to promote it and this and that here on mobile store you know if you get to some scale or if you're able to push it through like you know you will get promoted in a way is that mentality that is 100% true uh in fact that could that is one of the reasons why there are so many gaming companies out there because Play Store in general distributes and gives you visibility which otherwise you would not get you would not get so so I think that that certainly adds up to the whole thing interesting yeah this was probably one of the most enlightening conversations I've had in a very long time because I learned the entire lay of the layout like now I understand if I were to ever bet on a gaming this thing or or you know build a full game or whatever uh I'm not really a big fan of mobile games personally so it doesn't align my interest that's why I've never built a full mobile game I prefer to build PC demos or like we built this card game called overpowered the card game but we wanted it to be played on PC it's a it's just one of those things where I really do it because I want to make money I just want to have fun and I feel like I now have a full lay of the land of mobile games I know if I to spend money where I would do it I know some which are too expensive for me to do I know everything and I know which are bad ideas as well so thank you so much for this I owe you one this is a master class I'm sure the audience who stuck with us so far has also learned quite a bit um yeah I mean do you have anything last just say to the audience before you leave I can actually add one more thing in this particular category I think it will be useful for a lot of Developers one of the reasons why I've have uh also put simulators over here is because of Roblox uh and Roblox in itself gives you a little bit of window to develop a lot of things I mean you can you can make games you can make worlds inside Roblox so I think that is particularly very useful for young developers who are trying to get into gaming because uh Roblox is one of the places you can go and probably build some small things and get some initial success there as well very interesting so allowing players to build inside of your game is an unlock in itself right and then they're more invested it has elements of role playing so you're playing the role therefore you spend more on the game eventually very very fascinating thank you for being here with us thank you for enlightening us this is a master class this is like an MBA session or something like that right for but for gaming and this is the value of the series where I can just get experts who are like somebody had like 100 cres 500,000 crores in Revenue get them here and be like listen you know split apart your industry for me I'm a lay man I've got these this stack of things please break the industry away from me and I think this was very very useful like for me personally and I'm sure for the audience as well thanks for coming thank you I had a lot of fun yeah"}

reduced the demand for this with any of these job roles if you become very very good obviously you become s tier because everyone wants you none of this means that one role is better than the other it just means the demand and supply for these roles constantly changes if you're not a very good one you have been replaced by a $20 tool in the name of chat GPT it's not like you study one specific entrance exam you know the questions you know the answers you to keep trying stuff like this and then something stick and then some things don't just so you know every meal that you have ever had in your life is because of someone selling this is the role that Reddit is going to slaughter me for but let's take it on anyway ladies and gentlemen Welcome to our first tier rating video where it's a very interesting premise and last week the employees got together and they were asking each other well what's a really lucrative career for you to have in 2024 as a fresher and eventually that question came to me and I was thinking about it and I thought this is a good video to make but as you were thinking through the video I thought you know what this is not the right way to do it videos today not only have to add value to you it also has to be entertaining so in front of me Aur from the team has gone out to everybody in the office and ask them what do you think are the most lucrative roles in India in 2024 for a fresher and we've got a list of some of them I've only seen the first one and my job is to rate these job roles for 2024 for freshers now most of you might not know this but I started my career in recruiting I started a recruitment company when I was in my early 20s and and over the last decade I would have hired I don't know thousands of employees and even now we have a lot of employees that work with us across a broad range of roles a good 60 70% of the company is young people and a lot of them have this question on their heads which is is this the right role what's the best most lucrative role in 2024 so I thought fine I'll make a video about it I'll make it entertaining and there is one piece of nuance I want to tell you which is that all of this only applies to 2024 some of these job roles were hot in 2021 so this video if I made this in 2021 would have been very very different in 2024 it's a different video and these are my personal opinions you should feel free to disagree and with any of these job roles if you become very very good obviously you become s tier because everyone wants you but this is more for fresher entry-level job roles and hopefully it is useful to you without much further Ado let's take the first one which I've already seen which is product manager we have a lot of product managers in IND now especially on Twitter so I'll tell you the big problem with product managers okay especially in India I think a lot of product managers are unconsciously doing project management and I'll tell you the difference a project manager is somebody who says this is the scope of the project here are the 10 things we should do and this person goes out and puts together a full package after talking to people after doing research After figuring out what features are required this person puts down all these features in a document or in some cases actually makes an entire figma file out of it something that your developers can see and then your developers and designers actually sit together to make the product real Now understand the attraction of product management right which is oh I get to go I get to write this document on what you know we should build and I get to control designers and developers and tell them this is what you need to build but you know what most of the time you're entering a Job saying you're going to be a product manager but end up doing project management where somebody else is doing the requirements collection and figuring out what to build you are just writing the documents for it and that difference the difference between a product manager and a project manager is that a product manager has to make decisions on what to build not how to build it but what to build in the first place because one of the biggest wastes of time and I've run a software company before this one of the biggest Wast of time is building the wrong thing so you build something and you think users really want it and then you build it out and you realize nobody wants it so you as a company have not only wasted money on the product manager salary you also wasted money on the engineer salary because you've gone in the wrong direction the direction matters and the problem with being a fresher and doing product management is it's very hard to know right off the bat when you're 20 or 21 years old what direction a product or company should take because a lot of the things we believe stayed out of college are not how the real world Works in fact most of the time especially when building consumer products product managers especially fresher product managers that we've hired believe that oh you know the consumer want this feature or that feature or this is how they are this is their profile but in reality especially with consumer products most of these people are just you know sitting on a toilet or sitting in the Metro station they're like scrolling and then your notification popped up they clicked on it for half a second and then they went out so understanding how users behave takes a long time and that actually comes from life experience talking to a lot of people building something seeing that fail etc etc so for that reason and for the fact that when you're very very young it's hard to know what people really want and that takes some time I grade this a b which is true product management not project management is actually not wise to get into until you have one or two real core skills either design or development or something else because true product management requires you to have taste and taste is developed over time until that point it's a bit hard to do product management again these are my thoughts you might not necessarily agree with it but in my rankings product manager for freshers is a b in 2024 the next one is UI ux designer so there's a very interesting story I want to tell you about uiux designers in my last company we had quite a few and we were building a purely digital product and one of the interesting things that we noticed was that in the building phase in the first one one and a half years when we were building out the product we had a significant use for this role we had a significant use for somebody who would go build out the UI based on the product manager specifications change that look at every single screen build them out think about how the user flows through the app etc etc but after the core product was done the core software product was done we started seeing lesser and lesser use over time time and that's the model of the story I want to tell you which is when you're an early stage startup you actually need a lot of designers especially ux designers right to build out your app or to build out your product but as you become slightly more mature as one of these product companies you have less use for this or the designer spending far too little amount of time per day actually doing their job because it's really not required Beyond a certain point so the uiux designer in India is a role which follows a very strong power law if you are working for a company like Ked where they're shipping a feature every week this is a great job to have as a fresher but if you're joining a company where they don't have this much use and if you're not going to a top you know 00 unicorn startup I don't think this is a good long-term role for you to be in unless you're looking at switching every single year if you really want to be successful as a uiu designer in India and not work for these top 1500 companies you must be looking at opportunities abroad because there are some really good opportunities abroad and they will pay you well because it's expensive to hire a good UI X designer in the US or in Canada or any of those places but for India I think because of the limited uh job pool or the job pool being limited to a bunch of really cool companies and getting into those companies the competition is getting harder and harder and even those companies over time are shipping slightly lesser than before and they're already saturated good uiux designers are already sitting those companies doing fantastically well for themselves I think it's a little bit hard to break into which is why I'm going to put it in Grade B that doesn't mean we don't need uiio designers it just means it's competitive and it's a very specific segment of companies that this is in high demand for right now next this is the role that Reddit is going to slaughter me for but let's take it on anyway it's a full stack developer just so you know we have a lot of full stack developers in the company uh I started my career sort of at least the professional side of what I did uh building apps building that time web apps and I think being a full stack developer or being a developer is very close to my heart it is probably the most important thing I've ever done in my early years but is it a good job role in 2024 my answer is let's find out is let me explain so here's the thing okay companies need full stack developers and there's lots of openings for full stack developers but two or three very important things have happened that have reduced the demand for this there's a very interesting graph about developer hiring from the US so some in 2020 and 2021 there was this interesting phenomenon that took place called zerp which stands for zero interest rate phenomenon very interesting concept okay so what banks in the US started doing is they started setting the short-term interest rates to zero and they did this to stimulate growth right to stimulate economic growth they're like no don't put money in fds don't put money in safe Bank assets go and invest in the world so a lot of financial investors went out and started taking risks so what started happening is because the bank interest rates were not really attractive for many of the these investors they started taking their money and throwing it at riskier propositions like investing in startups so many of these investors went and invested with VCS like they gave their money to VCS they became something called limited partners and the VCS went and deployed money in lots of startups but the VC Dynamics it's a business where you invest in 100 things and as you all know maybe three or four of those things work out these risk-taking investors invest in a lot of tech startups and the reason they invest in Tech startups is because Tech startups have crazy growth if a tech startup works it can go from nobody to hero in like 3 5 10 years that's very quick compared to an old school industrial manufacturing thing that takes decades to even get anywhere right so people saw a lot of crazy growth with companies like Facebook or Salesforce or any of the others so they said let's replicate it again the only problem too much Capital flowed in in 2021 and when too much Capital flowed in Supply demand economics went up and down this is true for India as well because a lot of that foreign Capital actually came to India a lot of the unicorns you know today have raised a lot of money from outside of India because of this Zer phenomenon those people needed to place Capital somewhere India looked like an exciting place so they said let's go try the problem with that and I was there doing that environment and we were trying to hire developers we were trying to hire react Engineers during that environment and it was super competitive now you might not remember it but I remember it pretty well back then we had a team of almost 15 Engineers back then and even to hire a single Junior react engineer took time there was very little supply all the other companies were picking up Supply even if they didn't need Engineers they' pick them up and they'd be like hey we need these people and companies like us if we wanted some of those Engineers we had to cough up those Engineers were in such demand that many of them were not even respecting offer letters it was a very weird environment and I don't blame them at all for this because you know they were getting all the opportunities in the world and everything was coming to them so rates went up Supply went down and many of those Engineers started going on the internet and saying this is a great job to be in you all should be engineers and started making courses around it and this is weird for me to say because software is a very vast field you can do lots of things in software but this building an app or building a web platform became very very popular and we had a lot of newb Engineers try and say you know I want to go be in this industry I want to go work hard and become an engineer and study everything that's required and get into one of these startups the problem is we had too many of those people come out and a lot of colleges also started pushing people there and we now have this huge surplus of full stack developers or actually developers in India and then like any phenomenon it came to an end so a lot of those startups that had raised quite a bit of money started dying a lot of them started going through hard times and during hard times Engineers don't really increase the sales of the company so these companies started spending more on advertising or more on conserving the capital in the bank so they started letting go of many of these engineers and we had a huge dip and at the same time we had a new set of Engineers come out who were available to work and saying I will do it at much cheaper so by just inflating Supply and the demand falling we had a crisis couple that with the fact that Zer went away a lot of the investors had lost a lot of money and they said no I don't want to keep taking this foolish risk so they went back to investing in the safe way interest rates went up in the US so combined with all of that startup funding went through a winter in fact 20123 and 2024 were probably the worst years to be a startup founder because raising Capital was difficult even if you had traction investors were only going after very very proven slightly more mature companies and early stage risk was dwindling who suffered it was the full stack Engineers see here's the thing okay we still hire so many full stack Engineers if you are a full stack engineer we are still hiring it's a great job role to be in but if you are a mid full stack engineer if you're not the best in your industry there's a lot of competition for you in fact competition for a job for full stack Engineers is now reminding me of entrance exams uh we have a hiring platform where we put up a job role for full stack engineers and a bunch of other roles and the full stack developer role has a thousand applications whereas uh another role where we were hiring for a VFX artist has just three so it just goes to show you this is a very very competitive space and if you're good this rating doesn't matter to you if you're a fresher remember that this is competitive therefore I'm giving this a c so let's check out the next job roll it is content writer so the biggest threat for a Content writer is if you're not a very good content writer whether you're writing for SEO whether you're writing for YouTube or whether you're writing for a Blog if you're not a very good one you have been replaced by a $20 tool in the name of Chad GPT and at this point I would say you would be able to find three or four models for free CLA is free at this point right so it's very hard to be a bad content writer in this market because you're competing with literally a tool that costs almost nothing but if you're a good content writer then you will excel and the difference between a bad content writer and a good content writer is not about English it's not about your writing skill it is about domain expertise I'll give you an example if you ask a really good content creator who knows nothing about valerant to write an article on valerant the article that that person writes is going to be oer say but all the things that people want to watch all the things that people want to read the reason you're still on this video is because of nuance Nuance means more than meets the eye what do you know that's not just surface level what do you know that's deeper what do you know that you have Insight or experience in and for many content writers they're fresh out of college so therefore they have no insights in any space so the writing is generic which is unfortunately replaced by chat GPT or any of the other llms but the minute you can go deep then you win so I feel like instead of you looking at your role as just I'm a Content writer you should be looking at your role as I'm a researcher we actually have a lot of content writers and the really good ones are great at research they can go very very deep in fact one of the first conversations I had with Ganesh from think school I realized not only is this guy good at writing scripts he's so good at research he can spend hours and weeks really going deep into a topic and saying okay this is how it works okay this is what happened I see it with Aina as as well right with everything that she's doing at AV they go really really deep whereas there's a bunch of content writers who are not going that deep and just writing whatever comes to their mind or going to Google finding three articles and just putting them together I think domain expertise really matters all of us want to read and watch really quality uh content but for freshers because you don't have life experience in a specific space and content writing is really rewarding your life experience and what you know about a specific space I would rate this AC however if you're somebody very obsessed about a specific space like Finance you love Finance I don't understand much about Finance but if you love finance and you're willing to go very very very deep and you've been you know doing that stuff for one year or two years and you're also good at English and writing this is a great job for you but at that point you're not really a Content writer you're a finance subject matter expert and that's how you should pitch yourself all right next one is a VFX and 3D artist again I love this role we we're doing some VFX stuff right now uh where we're trying to composite me into a completely CG scene the hard part is getting the lighting right getting the camera tracking right it's a very fun role but in terms of jobs in the market today I would rate this a c and this is one thing I want you to get from this right it doesn't none of this means that one role is better than the other it just means the demand and supply for these roles constantly changes and right now the demand for a VFX and 3D artist is low but with movies like Ki coming out I think this is going to improve over time but as of today if you had to go to a through a 2 three four year degree whatever it is and then end up getting one of these jobs it's not going to be a very well-paying one unless of course you get to the top and build your own studio and whatnot that being said this is a very interesting role for us so if you want to actually be a VFX 3D artist please come join us if you have knowledge of blender if you have uh experience with tools like ax symmetry or nuke or even after effects for compositing we would love to work with you uh but I don't think we have too many job roles open for this we want to give some VFX services to our clients but you know we're not hiring like 50 of these people right awesome the next role is a content creator again power law dictates strongly in the role of content creator which means that if you're a top 1% content creator you're not watching this video you're probably producing one and making a lot of money congratulations but if you're not doing well now the problem is that there are 1.4 billion people in this country and many hundreds of millions are creating content every day most of them will give up by their 10th or 15th video being a content creator is hard it's worse odds to get through than entrance in exams right it's worse it's harder to be a successful content creator than it is to get through iits and it's very ambiguous path it's not like you study one specific entrance exam you know the questions you know the answers you to keep trying stuff like this and then some things stick and then some things don't very ambiguous role I think though that if you're a content creator and you join companies today and you can be a content creator for those companies that is a very exciting role so if I had to place this as you being a content creator by yourself doing it by yourself doing it for a living running a company I would place it a d if D existed or really really low along this uh tier list but because there is now a very clear opening for Content creat creators at companies and every company is dead serious about YouTube people are having ad fatigue the only way that companies used to attract uh customers is through advertising through either print and then TV and then Facebook and Instagram advertising you are getting tired of seeing ran Singh in another ad yet again on your Instagram feed the only way around it is for companies to create organic content and therefore if you're a content creator for a company I will put this at an a now I know how easy it is to just screenshot this and say haha how is he saying content creators is a and full stack developers C that's why you have to watch the full video so you get the context next is an AI ml engineer now I think there are three ways to divide the AI world right like at engineers in the AI world there's people who are doing research who are going out and you know they're trying things and they're writing papers on those things they're purely academics and I don't think being an AI researcher is a particularly commercially rewarding role especially in India You' have to sort of you know work under a professor and they're not very commercially minded It's a very status-driven game very Noble and very valuable and we have seen really valuable things come out of this like wave tulip which came out from triple it so researcher is good but I don't think it makes you that much money the next AI related role is probably an AIML engineer where you're training models you know over time as these larger models have got good like a GPD 40 or a clae building your own models doesn't make so much sense like there's a lot going on in computer vision models but now a GPD 40 or a Claude can just see a picture you send it and do a much better job the reason is because they trained on a lot more data than you could get your hands on and because these models are multimodel and they have really long context it is a little hard to come out and say I will build my own model and be commercially successful on it remember there's this huge set of people on Twitter who are you know fine tuning these models building these models we were like that last year right we were F models we said maybe there's a commercial value here but we didn't really find too much commercial value there it's it's a good engineering exercise you train a model you see the loss scills go down you're happy right and you're like you know I soled it I know I can do this but will that lead to money do companies pay for this right now no right or some companies do and they have lots of data and very specific use cases and getting into some of these companies is very competitive the Third Kind of Engineers and we made fun of them last year was people who are building rapper startups which is you're taking one of these apis and you're solving a problem but unfortunately if you really look through the last one year except for maybe the top 10 AI companies right who have raised hundreds of millions of dollars each most of the people who have really made money are the people who are doing things like oh well you know I have a bunch of PDFs I want to chat with it and these are the Freelancers these are people doing it by themselves running their own Indie companies and even at companies a company has a problem they don't really care about what tech you use they have a problem they're like well you know I have a lot of data on this can you tell can you give me some insights out of this or well you know I want to create content and you know I I don't have a presenter is can AI make a presenter for me so using existing models and building out solutions for companies solving real problems that they have which we are currently spending money on is valuable like I said there's 7.1 billion people with mobile phones in the world and there are only 20 million or 30 million mid-journey users so many companies in the world have not been exposed to even the most available AI tools now obviously just using tools is not what an AIML engineer does but what I'm saying is that there's a spectrum and the people who use the models and the apis to build useful things are right now seeing the most commercial success we hire a lot of these people companies really want us to build some of these Solutions out for them therefore I'm putting this at Na and of course if you're a great researcher or a great model trainer and you find the right fit of company you're going to make a killing right whether in India or abroad and if you're one of the coveted few that can do research or build your own models there is no lack of demand for you there is an incredible amount of demand and many of those people at least in the US are now building and running their own companies they're giving it a shot they're seeing what happens if they commercialize some of this we might realize over the years that these are probably far better as jobs than they are as startup risks because as startup risk you're supposed to drisk everything from day one you're supposed to play the lowest risk way use the third party models you know don't even do anything by yourself get some track action show that the customers want something and then slowly replace the stack with your own models and your own technology uh that's what you're supposed to do so I don't think it's a best startup risk but is it a good job absolutely next is a digital marketing specialist everyone's curious about where I'm going to put this but I think I'm going to put it here sorry we've run out of space on the C track but I'll tell you why running an ad it used to be hard several years ago today if you've ever run a ad on Facebook or Instagram the recent years everything is auto optimized there's very little rocket science apart from the creative itself and I would argue that it's far better to be a content creator and think about what creative will run what will people want to watch versus something like this right a digital marketing specialist where you're saying that you know I'm only good at running ads now a digital marketing specialist is supposed to do more than just ads but this debate about should we do organic content or should we pay for advertising most companies are going to do both so there's still scope for this but it's also a very competitive space where Google and Facebook are automatically doing the things that you are supposed to do they're automatically seeking out the right audiences installing pixel is not really rocket science so I'm unsure of what these people would do and it's better for you to be a content creator with some understanding of how to run ads or how to you know do paid campaigns versus you know be this and then figure out oh I don't know how to create content I don't know what people want to watch so ultimately it's about what do people want to watch and as being a content creator you can gain that life experience right by going through your Instagram feed and seeing what's working for other people is the one space where you don't really need too much domain expertise to get started next is sales executive sales executive now there's been a lot of talk about how AI is going to replace sales X I don't think that's true I think the feeling when you go Shake somebody's hand I'm talking in person Shake somebody's hand or talk to them and understand their context AI is far away from doing that AI can speak well AI can mimic a voice well but if you've had like a long conversation like many turns like 20 30 turns with AI you'll realize that's some point people can tell they're talking to a bot and it's it doesn't really understand people's context as well as you'd like to at least today we're talking about 2024 with all of this but a sales exact who can go out and win bread for the company who can actually make money for the company that's s you generate cash I'll tell you one thing okay and India has grown up being a country that hates sales that hates the idea of going out and talking to people and taking money from them just so you know every meal that you have ever had in your life is because of someone selling either your dad or your mom mom or your grandfather or your dad's boss or your dad's colleague sales is the only thing either directly or indirectly putting Bread on your table and people tend to forget this with digital jobs nobody wants to do the job where you're doing 10 calls a day I do a lot of calls a day right nobody wants to do their job it sucks but the people who can who are like you know everyone else is going to these jobs that look attractive but is behind a desk but this job where I actually have to call people and get rejected a lot of times this is the job where in my opinion if you're a fresher and you're really motivated and you're not distracted to go out and do something else this is a great job to have and every to every company a sales rep that creates money out of thin air no company cuts off that that person like think about it okay let's say a sales rep was generating 5 lakhs a year in Revenue but their salary is 4 lakhs in any crisis I would not lay off that person because that person is bringing the company money very secure role and if you can do well because salesp people are coin operated they get commissions on every deal most good companies should give you commission on sales there's no cap to how much money you can make it's the closest to being an entrepreneur right where you're earning your own bread and every sale like everything depends on you and the brand of the company that you're working for one piece of advice and I kind of alluded to it but one piece of advice for sales is if you join a company where people already have a demand for that product or service then you'll find your job much easier if you join a very very fast growing company and become a sales rep there you'll make a lot more money than joining a bad company with a bad product because you'll have to work harder to sell so a lot of sales people say man the product and service matters far more and the customer demand are customers really tearing their hair out to use your thing if they are your sales job will be easy do you have a lot of distribution do you have a lot of marketing then your sales job will be easier it's truly hard mode if you're going to an unknown company with a bad product so I think the hardest thing in this job is choosing what company to work for luckily all companies even the best ones are constantly hiring people who can sell and bring them money so this is not a job role where you have a lot of competition if you can actually generate money you will be added on top along with so many other sales rep to be able to do your job unfortunately India has demonized this and we've seen this with b and bunch of other companies where sales rep are like ah sales bad but sales is what runs our economy and ultimately if you want to be really successful in life this is what you have to crack therefore it is s year out of respect for the job and for everything that it has put on the table for all of us next we have a fan favorite video editor uh I think the entire reason video editors have blown up is not even about skill I think it's just blown up because the demand has blown up so our learnings on this is that Gio really made India consume a lot of video content and now most of you are spending anywhere between 3 to 5 hours a day scrolling video content either reels or shs or whole YouTube videos even on Twitter it's a bunch of videos now so somebody needs to be producing all those videos and while there are content creators who are producing this videos in the last one or two years we've started seeing a lot of companies produce videos too we produce videos for a lot of companies there are a lot of companies who are our clients on our content side of the business right like Zoho zeroa many of the others and there are a lot of editors on their teams so there's a it's a very high demand role very uh low Supply because for some reason nobody wants to be a video editor for some reason it feels like an unsexy role because 5 years ago it was associated with Bollywood and you only had a small bunch of jobs that you could get I think that has changed and because of the supply demand economics same thing that happened in 2021 with the full stack Developers I think video editor demand has just shot through the roof and even V despite of the fact that Aina my wife runs a video editing cohort and I'm able to hire people from her cohort there's still a lack of good video editors in India and I know some of the salaries that those people in the cohorts are getting they are being paid through the nose it is it feels unfair if you're sitting as a TCS employee after working four years and then finally getting a job to see that a video editor is making more than you but it is a true fact and it's not true because that skill is better or this skill is worse that's the wrong way to think about it it's because of supply and demand there's a lot of demand and there's low Supply and many of these companies are serious about channels and because of short form one more thing that short form content has done and it's very important for you to understand this with long form a person could consume let's say a 10-minute video right a person could consume maybe five videos or 10 videos after which they'd get exhausted in that same let's say 1 hour period where You' consume six videos you are now able to consume 60 shots so the number of successful content creators and companies have gone up 10x just because content has become short form most people have not realized this we have right short form content allows more winners and because of that there are more editors that are required for those channels and therefore because of the supply demand economics and because I've seen some of the salaries coming out of avv I would give this an a as you can see I'm not choosing any of these roles based on how hard they are or what the skill set required is we haven't spoken too much about that I'm picking these based on Supply demand in the market right now now many of you might argue well 5 years later it might not be useful a developer will make far more money over 5 years than a video editor but you know what we have seen that not to be true with video editors and we have a bunch of video editors we have video editors that work for this channel too they start out as video editors but eventually just like product managers over time anyone can be a product manager you could have started in design and then you can move to product management you could have started in something else like development and then move to product management it's the same with video editors you start as a video editor and then you can head marketing you're basically playing to be the CMO cuz if everything is video then marketing is also video right you are not reading as much text as you used to you're not reading books anymore so if everything is video the best way to be a CMO or a marketer or anyone in the marketing department is to first start as a video editor so we're seeing a lot of that and also there's another role where you could be a Channel producer you can just manage the entire Channel which is a very lucrative role today because I know how many creators are hiring for this I know how many companies are hiring for this and they are throwing serious cash at it which is is why it's here now I know some of you will make fun of me for this and I don't mind but I have a much clearer view of the supply demand economics from here where we work with a lot of companies doing this also I'm a little bit biased because we are hiring many of these people and if you a video editor we probably have like 40 job roles open for you I'm not even kidding 40 job roles opens for you it's just Supply demand that I'm talking about I'm not talking about skill the next one is robotics engineer you know till now we've covered only digital jobs I only wanted to cover digital jobs because if you go into offline jobs there are so many more jobs right there's driver and you so many other things but I think you know robotics engineer is the one non-digital job I think everything else is digital is the one non-digital job but I'll still take it anyway we shouldn't have put this here but being a robotic engineer in India is a good idea there's a podcast with Lex fredman and one of the founders of Boston Dynamics where he says the only real money in robotics is selling robots for factory industrial use cases of robots this is going to change this is something where I'd place it at a at a a be C today again because of Supply demand not because this is a bad role I place it as a c but at some point maybe in 3 years 5 years 10 years this is going to be an S right because everyone's going to there's also going to be a level of abstraction so right now when we do robotics experiments we use something called Ross which is Robot Operating System and over time what will happen is that will be abstracted we get it'll get easier and easier to control these robots many of them will come with sdks that you can use there'll be a reactif foration of it where it gets pretty easy to enter the field there'll be lots of documentation to the documentation sucks most of it for the robot we got is in Chinese so over time that's going to change and over time this is going to be an S tier role but for now I'm not even going to put it on the board because it's just too early to talk about this last but not the least is the actor unfortunately there not a good job for you to be in being an actor is super risky it has lower odds than being a content creator theator as well most actors are failures the 30 people that are very very successful are insanely successful and there's no middle layer in content creation there's a middle layer there's a layer three there's a layer four where everyone's making some kind of money there's micro creators making some kind of money M creators that making some kind of money you won't see micro actors making too much money right there's movie there's TV and then everyone else makes nothing or his background actor or background dancer where you don't know when your next paycheck or meal is going to come from so therefore I will put this at a see because if you're 20 years old and you're taking the risk to be an actor it is foolish but sometimes some of those foolish decisions can be great stories and you might be the next Shah ruk Khan uh so I don't want to discourage you again this is more about Supply demand this is not about your skill sucks I I know I have to repeat that many times because I know how the internet thinks but yeah this is it I hope this was useful it's a very very long video but uh I hope this was useful and I hope uh you take away something for it make sure you subscribe and I'm we're going to be doing a lot more more videos like this for different different things the next one we're going

{"video_id": "uY0_O1ZHims", "title": "Building a Drone in India! (With Cost Breakdown)", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY0_O1ZHims", "transcript": "now I see why you guys went offline this is beautiful today I am at the scaler School of Technologies offline campus I'm about to get a crash course in how to build a drone by using off-the-shelf components from a team of brilliant 20-year-old students these students will walk us through every step of the process from selecting Motors and propellers to integrating liar sensors and AI for autonomous flight capabilities not just this at the end of this we we will test it by actually taking a flight so without wasting any time let's get right into it yeah man we would love to show you the campus sure uh so yeah uh this is the campus like you know the concept of ss right by industry for industry so when we were thinking of the campus we thought of how uh I mean from a curriculum design point of view what Microsoft wants what what Amazon wants let me start with showing you the classroom oh this is huge this is much larger than I thought it would [Music] be now this entire space that you see we have equal amount of space on that side which is the innov just the Innovation lab that looks really exciting this part is a classroom but that looks interesting hi how you doing to you likewise this looks damn good this actually looks good this feels futuristic too this is your robotics drone lab arvr a IML and that's your iot lab this is drones hi guys sir I'm going to be seeing a drone today you're going to be teaching me how to hi sir this is Dave make and ride a drone I know some of it but hopefully you'll give me a full lesson on this hi hi how long you've been working on this for the last two months nice I'm excited to see how it works so today we're going to find out like whether drone the Drone actually flies and what it's made out of so we're going to do three things one is you're going to show me that the Drone flies then there are two ways I learn right one is either I build something or I break it down breaking it down is much faster so I would love to have that broken down because otherwise building it I think will take a few hours so you'll break it down layer by layer until we get to the motors and the esc's and whatnot you're going to explain it to me and then hopefully I'm able to understand it okay I'm a drone Noob though I know nothing about drones except for the very Basics so you have to treat me like a lay man okay def shall we go yeah come can I fly it yeah do you have any experience so I have zero experience flying a drone but let me try I'm good with an Xbox controller so this is the throttle so this will this will dictate the amount of thrust it throws down and it will go up this is left and right this is called roll technically it's called roll roll P correct you know Lord man you're not a noob so this is this is basically your this is here this is this is for the pitch and this is for the rooll okay got it yeah that's it yeah that's it okay let's start when we connect the battery and then there is an arm switch on which will arm the cter so there are two uh two arm switches one is on the copter and one is on the remote you guys should move away yeah they should move away because someone will die and then I'm not responsible very slightly give thrt yeah see it goes up then you can control it two in your take it right yeah perfect perfect take it right oh but this will be an autonomous drone yeah this will be an autonomous and it's driving how through La Raspberry Pi and there will be a flight control system on board okay which will control it and uh give the FX hog the input which we give it through the radio it will basically tell the Drone to like go no no but if it's autonomous why are you giving it instructions we are not giving it the instructions the Raspberry Pi on board will give it the instructions so so so play play play it for me so it is the world through lar is a 3D representation of the world can you explain what lar is to the people watching lar is basically an instrument through which we can uh sense the range of the object uh in front of the Drone what's the full form for the audience uh light detection and ranging okay nice so it's seeing the world it's giving you a 3D representation of the world then you're bringing that world into uh the Raspberry Pi yeah right and then you're deciding where to navigate purely on the lar on the camera exactly okay but what it can the camera see behind itself no for that the Drone will just rotate 180° okay okay you want to break that down for me yeah yeah yeah yeah sure sure sure hey you want to quickly take a detour and go see the Vision Pro folks hello you have to be honest how many times have you used the device in the last one month probably daily for 3 to 4 hours really yes Apple loves you so basically when we renovate our home so we are not able to visualize which panel will look good or how with my furniture how this color will go correct or not so for that we have built a visualization where you can place panels on your walls with your furniture applied means like uh if there is a TV and table so panel will be placed behind that so you can uh take a feel of all home with the new panel uh with the extra thing you are adding and you can decide which panel is look can good or wall panel like uh nowadays uh know people are applying wall panels like wooden panels or some acrylic or something something like that so Urban company has started a new segment uh in the in the business where they're replying wall panels so you're doing some kind of wall detection yeah W detection and whole construction of mesh around the surfaces nice uh so if you touch the any panel it will be placed so if I touch this panel yeah you have to tap it from the index finger yeah so it's placed oh nice this is actually cool this is way better in the reception area out there no this is this is this is still really nice this is still really nice so that part is really great because the more complex it gets yeah segment all of this out you can use Sam you know what Runway ml does something very similar you can do it in real time so can I also tap that no we have uh we have nots dis the ceilings are disabled nice I'm already here to destroy the lab and how are you doing this uh this we have used a combination of plane detection and mesh reconstruction nice so to achieve the and how are you texturing the mesh why don't you use stable diffusion and texture the mesh so that I can I can just say make it look like flowers and then there's a flower wallpaper so we trying to work on that because uh there's a mesh resource we can place the mes So currently we are trying to uh Implement a video on it so it will look like the Matrix oh nice so on the whole layer it will place Matrix so zeros and W like an LED wall yes like an LED wall so in of wall will be the whole en so you'll be inside the Matrix so trying to build that right now nice this is pretty impressive okay back to the Drone folks let's go see what they're up to start with this these are the motors yeah correct these are all the motors correct so then you got these so how much does this cost just the fan the fan do the fan 50 rupe that's it yeah that's how much does these motors cost uh 600 rupes nice and they're driven I by an ESC ESC yes you're right so the esc's are here can you explain to the audience what an ESC is ESC stands for an electronic speed controller what it does is basically takes signal from the flight controller it gives the motor the current According to which um the motor should spin at what rpn should it spin that is decided by the pixhawk what is the pixhawk the flight controller yeah the Pix Haw is the flight controller which we're using so the pixhawk is sending data to the esc's which is then controlling your motors which is then making your fans rotate at for a certain speed the job of the ESC is to control the RPM of the motor in simple words nice and what does this do what is radio telemetry radio telemetry through with through this we can we can make the pixo communicate to our laptops using a Telemetry um communication device so what you can tell the laptop uh what the pixhawk should do yeah I mean the laptop can tell can tell the what the Pix can do what is this this is the uh receiver for the remote for the radio radio controller uh receiver radio receiver can you show me the liar in the camera module yeah yeah yeah sure this is the liar this is the liar module so basically how how it works is you see there are two two black patches on the top so basically one sends light so it's only forward liar usually a liar model is 360 no this one is that's what we said this is a one point lar okaying so it's only looking in front yeah it's only looking in front creating a map of the world in front of it yeah nice and the Drone can rotate 360° so we can create a 360 map as well nice so how it works is it sends this light beam and this this one receives the light beam they are they are pointed like this so uh it calculates the time which it uh took to send and receive and it multiplies that by the speed of light to calculate the distance got it and what does that create a 3D map of the uh mapping is done on the software side it'll just tell the um range of the object in front of it distance of the object what is this this is the brain of the Drone like the where the ml models and all the object detection model fire model you're running everything locally nothing on cloud no nothing on cloud like there would be problem if it would run on cloud like it would it would need internet to access the cloud right so if we do that the Drone might fail at any point we don't know so basically you're saying with this combination of the frame uh your pixhawk your Telemetry devices uh your esc's here your Motors and your fans anyone can build a drone at home yes yeah uh but with a little bit of knowledge about about the calibration procedures nice which go which is which is very easy to find do you want to run me through the ml model that you guys have on the system yeah like the fire detection model it will take the visual inputs from the camera and the light up like from the L it will calculate distance but it will take the visual inputs from the camera and it will send to the RP and RP that it will take the one frame out of that video and it will process the image it will detect the fire and if there is a fire it will do the PID control that is like minimizing the error for it yeah whereas the because the camera is sitting on top of the Drone and there's Jitter is that why there there is that to to combat that thing we have something called as a jimble which will stabilize the camera feed and what it'll do is like right now the fire is over to this part of the frame so what it'll try to do is to bring it over to the center so for that there is the this much error so you see like this much error is there so to correct that there is something called as pit controller so the pit controller will determine how exactly will it will it move on to the will it take this fire to the center and once it's in the center you just have to take the Drone towards the fire and then uh that's how we we we'll we'll be on top of the fire at so you're right on top of the fire then yeah then there is like then then there will be a custommade dropping mechanism which we're developing right now and it'll drop the fire drop the ball onto the fire and that's it got it so basically like the Drone has to go forward so what we we give the input of forward let's say we give the so it translates that into exact rotation so you don't have to map out what has to rotate at what point exactly like if we if if we tell it to manually ding in RPMs you're just saying forward and that's translating into how should will basically sync all the motors with itself the anticlockwise with the anticlockwise with the clockwise with the clockwise so basically like go forward so so how figure yeah it it'll tell these two Motors just spin faster and and go forward got it yeah I think everyone has a good view of how it works so hopefully audiences at home you learned like me how a drone works and how it's able to put out fires with a combination of AI and uh 85,000 rupees roughly for the Drone yes nice very very very impressive lovely this is super impressive thank you so much for having the patience to answer all my stupid questions every question is important and uh very very impressive uh are you guys planning to start a company out of this are you planning to commercialize this soon nice we have plans but not commercialize this like do more of like nonprofit kind of a thing still very very impressive congrats how old are you uh I'm 20 you're 20 years old I'm 18 I'm 18 oh my God  superb stuff my audience is used to the fact that we'll cover something and then they'll double click on certain things as they like some people will be like no I will build my own flight controller some people will be like like frame 3D print some people will be like no you know I want to use some other type of Motors whatever like you can feel this is the Basel line and you can feel free to modify it as you want but what I'm also really impressed with is this nice Iron Man looking laboratory that you guys are sitting in and what would you like them to build next yeah what I would really like what we are working on I'll tell you so again we've just started a few weeks ago but uh we are working on a quadruplet bot right so we got this bot from China called the yaha boom Dogzilla and then many of these available there's the unitary go1 and stuff right so the cool thing about the bot is it's built it so there's a open-source platform called Ross Robot Operating System where I can control the bot now through tele operation yes but I can also you know write my own software for it to be my friend for it to hang out with me and it has all the devices built in so I need to buy like a separate lar module I didn't need to buy a separate camera module every everything came in right there's this unique opportunity Boston Dynamics did to put a skin on top of the bot yeah for I don't know if you saw this they put yeah they put like a dog skin on top of so the question I often wonder is is there a boatlike business possible but for Robotics and drones and for anything right like where China produces or whatever in the early days China will produce it we will build a business on top of it reskin it whatever and then over over time you can build bring the manufacturing back to India cuz the other way around is super risky right where you build this and then you commercialize this and then what if it what if you take it to Market and nobody buys it it's scary and you've lost a lot of money you've lost your money investors money whatever it is the other way around where you're just buying a product and reselling it to see is there a market first and then once you've seen if there's a market first and if there is a market then you bring everything in-house right so yeah like people keep saying India needs a lot more manufacturing but actually India also needs appetite for this because I don't know who would buy consumer robotics right now in the country yeah right so we are also experimenting it take like 3 4 5 years for us to and might not even work like 99% it might not even work but as an engineer that intellectual curiosity never leaves you see I mean like people if they get introduced to robotics then they they'll have that Curiosity of learning so that introduction part is most important I guess yeah I mean one thing that people don't get which you know I'm glad that this one lab kind of proves it right that software is not just one thing it's not just react development right it's like if you're good at software you can do XR then you could say okay I understand XR like he's working on Unity right there yes right so it's not that different Unity is I mean it is different but it's not that different from what you're doing like pitch raw uh pitch Your Role I first learned it in flight simulator Microsoft flight simulator then I've used it in Unreal Engine and then I found the the same Concepts here because you're moving in 3D space right so it it's obvious you eventually come through pitch role you so all the concepts translate but the way regular engineering colleges is like very um it's very oh you know it's you have to learn only this thing or you have to learn only that thing my question is if you're a good game developer right why then you can also translate some of those skills to robotics if you're a good Rob because a lar like especially the 3D lar not this one but the 3 lar is creating a map of the world and you're navigating based on the map in Unreal Engine there used to be this thing it used to be called AI but it's not really AI it used to be called something called Blackboard where you would make decisions you would say hey here's a decision tree right all animations unreal are State machines so these Concepts translate across platforms across things you can do and one of the cool things I really love about this lab is there's no differentiation like it's not like this is the center for react Engineers India right it's like okay if you feel like going there and doing some XR if you feel like like you're also using AI in this yeah we are right so there's no real distinction so what we feel when we do stuff is um it's experimentation and maybe we might not build a successful robot or build a successful robotics company most likely that's going to be the case but we learn something from it that we can apply somewhere else and it's also good content right it's all curiosity and the hunger to learn things and Tinker things and it's fun like what will you do in life otherwise exactly uh I mean I hate saying this because I I I'll get belted for this but you should keep it anyway but I think Engineers have like good Engineers generally have the most fun in life cuz that that I think scientists have even more fun I I wouldn't know but just that feeling where something just works and you've sat all night I'm sure you all know the feeling you you sat all night and like so I have one last question around this how did you guys get in did you did you just do does any 18-year-old just walk into this lab like why are there so few of you how how did you get here basically like there's first of all there's an exam called as net and we have to what's it called net how spell that for me NSE okay yeah uh you have to first get clear that exam and then there will be two sets of interviews one will be math interview and one will be dreams and personal interview in which they'll see your dreams and aspirations and after these two interviews and this test you're done you're you're inside this inside this institution that's and the exam itself is kind of a learning thing like there is a part called learnability where they put the concept itself in real time and they ask you the question what's what will be the answer of it so adaptive learning ability not not mugging yeah so they'll give they'll teach you they'll give you a paragraph which will teach you the concept so in my case it was like binary uh conversion so I didn't know about that concept but like I learned it on the spot and I was able to like clear the questions on the spot so you have to learn it on the spot and clear the questions nice super impressive and it's not only like learnability like if you have the the logical reasoning and Mathematics thing you'll also get selected into this like college like the math thing in computer science also in AIML whatever thing you do majorly in computer science it's only match what dat yeah that's the only risk with this place right the minute your Entrance Test becomes too easy yeah you get like someone bad who's not contributive in a group you know you have that right in a group project even if one guy doesn't contribute it's done yeah so with offline institutes like the entrance test is very important I'm glad there's there's an interesting there's a good Entrance Test how how how do people apply for the nset nset is like completely online you just have you'll have to fill a form you'll have to go on to scal School of Technology website you have to register it there and you can give the exam so that's been a look at the fascinating drone lab and the impressive offline campus at Scala School of Technology we got to see some brilliant students helping me understand how autonomous drones work by breaking things down what really stood out was how they blend different Tech skills it's not just about coding or building things it's about combining everything to solve real world problems if you're into Tech and want to learn by doing Scala School of Technology might be worth exploring so click the link in the description that's it for this video and I'll catch you guys in the next one bye"}

is a motivation problem about only 3% of the people who start online self-based program finish it I think there's you guys there Master Union there sta how do you differentiate versus them we are always preparing you for the future name the top tech companies in the country chances you're going to find us killer Al there already you've probably been asked questions about Deon 100 times now right basically it makes a software engineer maybe 5x or 10x more productive some of those people competing against you are freaks of motivation students today are far less satisfied with their own achievements than I think you and I used to be ladies and gentlemen today I'm with abim Manu and bavik I think these guys are some of the most fantastic people in edtech uh abanu has been running Scala for a very very long time uh you know sometimes I keep texting him he has lots of insights in the attech world he also has the most counter intuitive insights into the at Tech World which is he thinks very differently uh there are a lot of insights where I don't think average person would agree with him and I think today we'll go over everything right today we'll go over future of software programming we'll go over future of business with AI coming out we'll go over Devon what what is really Devon going to do we'll also go over their stories and hopefully by the end of it you walk away learning a little more about how online and offline education businesses work and you also kind of get a view of how the nature of business CH will probably change over the next few years we'll also learn a little bit more about Tier 1 tier 2 and tier three colleges so stay [Music] ladies and gentlemen so you know I think in December I reached out to abanu and I said uh abanu run scaler and I said you should come and be on a podcast with me because scalers has actually been one of the startup successes in India right they've they've been around for a very very long time I've known you since interview bit so they've done a phenomenal job and I think some of that story deserves to be highlighted and I also think because software is changing so rapidly and also I think because software is changing rapidly and every business sort of become like a tech business business is changing rapidly right so both software and business I know you guys have a lot of insights on and I thought having a podcast having both of you on and just you know understanding your story your thoughts some of the counterintuitive insights that you've had about uh teaching code about teaching business I want to know all of it right so welcome to the show I think before anything I want both both of you to introduce yourself uh from you know ideally from your childhood what yeah I'm sure some people you know they say this right like from early years you were exhibiting something different so I want to know from both of you you are allowed to brag for the next you know one minute or so but I'll start with your so I have very I think now looking back it looks un it's not a very common Journey that I had I grew up in a very very small town in mp called Amar kuk uh it is a village within uh you know kind of you know tribal District it was because it used to be the largest tribal District uh of the country called shul uh amarant although is a famous in the like older people know about it because it's a very old city it has its uh mentions in the ramay and Mahabharat uh so Ram back in the day he spent times of his when he was doing the vanas he spent some time there um so it's it's on a hill it's very interesting that it's a hill station with an MP uh back in the days early '90s when I was growing up uh it was a town with no telephone line whatsoever the newspaper used to get delivered the next day uh the national newspapers because it's so remote that you know on the same day there's no logistical Network to deliver the newspaper same day um so I I I spent very early childhood there and then after school I I went to trip Hyderabad um so another interesting thing is that uh while triple Hyderabad is considered the mecca for the computer science in India before ending up there I had never used computer in my life I had only seen it from a distance because every year in 10th class 12th class you will have your results being declared or the results of competitive exams uh so you'll go to the only cyber cafe in the city to get your results so from afar you can see it there's a computer on which the operator will take out the result give you a print and charge 10 Rupees for that uh so that was my interaction with computer when I entered College uh now it's like you know like in the middle of Hyderabad surrounded by like I remember Microsoft shared boundary with our campus um then Google a kilometer down and then there is TCS campus right across the corner reinforces huge campus of maybe 150 acres right across what I feel is that growing up in this small town away from you know the fancy schools Etc sometimes people say it's a disadvantage I feel it was a huge Advantage yeah because it kind of kept that Natural Curiosity um and you know the and hunger and hunger that you you know like there is nothing like basically I was never motivated to just like you know know facts I would look at things I'll try to understand what is happening uh what should be happening uh question the status quo and because of that I was able to often take decisions which would not be usual decisions it could be for example back in 2006 when I decided to join Tri Hyderabad I had options to join even you know more older famous established institutes I I remember my late father he was pretty unhappy with me because Tri Hyderabad back back then almost 15 years now yeah uh rather 20 close to 20 years now 18 20 years Tri Hyderabad was not a very famous college back then today of course it's a very short of Institute and like I just as a 17 18 year old kid I kind of met this rebellious decision that I will not go to some of the 5080 year old famous sort after colleges but I would rather go to Tri Hyderabad because because I could see that you know what I want to study what I want to do that is happening there um similarly when I had to like you know choice of jobs uh I joined so before starting scaler I I worked at Fab for a while when I joined them it was a company with five people and with maybe just a million or two in investment right I had option of let's say going to a company with 10,000 employees Fortune 500 or maybe Fortune 100 I turned that down took this up again not a decision that many people managed to take and then four years into that then I again managed to take a decision that I was doing I was fairly comfortable in the job uh making decent enough money for myself doing decent in the job appreciated by the peers and and the and the bosses but then again again my father was confused why would you quit this everything is so sorted people aspire to get to at such a place why would you quit that and want to build something of your own right so I think uh this overall have been my journey and I think uh I attribute a lot of that to you know the environment I was part of between when I was 5y old to 15 year old in a remote small place where you get to think from first principles not in a rat race that I must clear this exam I must do this I this is a Chase uh being away from that I think was very helpful while growing up so hav you you literally run Uber in India what's your story like how do you get to running Uber in India sure uh very different Journey all together born and raised uh in South Bombay on a silver spoon it's like you guys are Polar Opposites Polar Opposites I grew up in a fancy apartment in South Bombay typical marwadi family uh business family textiles um you know had all the luxuries that I could ask for uh growing up uh did my schooling in in South Bombay as well then I did my junior College also in South Bombay uh and then I did my engineering uh which was in university of Mumbai and by the time I was in the third year of engineering uh two things happened that defined a lot of the things that happened for me uh in my future life one was my family business that my father was running went through substantial losses they had to shut down the entire business uh repay a lot of the loans that led to family disputes and pretty much going from living in South Bombay fancy Apartments we were down to essentially living in a rental apartment uh struggling to just make ends meet um simultaneously when I was on my thir of engineering I almost decided to quit engineering and uh the reason for that was because I just felt I was wasting my time there right um typical traditional engineering College didn't feel like I was learning enough there was no motivation at all on one side I'm seeing my father struggle through his you know Fiasco that happened the business the the factory Etc on the other hand I'm like I'm spending time here I'm not even Lear learning much that I can take back home with me and you know sort of almost had this very tough conversation that you have with your father once in your life across the table I'm like Dad I want to quit and like what do you mean he like I don't want to do engine anymore I'm okay I'll join you instead right cuz I felt like you need me I'm my dad of course sat me down like you're third year already it's just one more year just get a degree we'll figure it out later so I went ahead finished my four years of engineering I was good in studies after graduating uh we had about five or six companies that came on campus to hire I sat for zero interviews was very clear I was going to go work with my dad and he was restarting his Factory for manufacturing shirts uh so I thought go join him I survived for 3 months and I realized this is not my place at all like this I can't I can't handle uh the the requirements of you know the labor that goes into uh running a family business the factory Etc so my dad is like this is not for you I'm okay I'll run this for how long I can and I'll gradually shut it down you got to move on uh and that's when I took up my first job which was actually a software developer with a called atos origin among the top IT consulting firms back then providing IT services for European region we based in Belgium Netherlands and and Luxembourg primarily did that for almost about two years and while I was working there I did a lot of programming in a very old language it was actually a 4 generation language called progress it mimicked C++ to some extent did coding for roughly about about two years realized I am a good engineer from a terrible coder just one very interesting trivia there huh so you were right writing 4gl of progress right during my college days I was doing internship for progress and I was building the 4gl programming language so interesting interesting my my first programming language was delphy I'm just putting it in the head right there with you guys no so so I did some programming progress but I think what's interesting the project I was working on was basically a manufacturing company that was based out the US and I was building the entire Freight solution along with the team and that going be really curious to understand okay what I'm doing sitting in a silo in a small part of Mumbai how is that really impacting the entire business started Googling a lot about the business itself about the company was called qad remember now um I'm like what does this company really do what are the different parts of the business I start getting really curious about it and I did a diploma in financial management at nury monji uh so I used to do a part-time course work through the day and go in the evening for those classes and that going be further interested into understanding just the different facets of business in the first place so a product of I'm a product of engineering but started gravitating towards the understanding all parts of the business doing that made me realize that there was more to learn about the business but the diploma enough wasn't enough right diploma by itself wasn't enough uh which is why I applied for University abroad and I did my u ms in general management and finance uh at University of Illinois at arbana champagne uh in the US I spent about two years doing that fundamentally changed me first time I was away from home you know making my own bed cooking my own food interacting with people from all over the world um I think there were people from roughly about 50 different nations part of my classroom learning different cultures uh and more importantly really getting into the meat of understanding business in general there was a specific thing that the program had which drew me towards that program which was called illo business Consulting it was a consulting firm that was run by the students on campus that was Source real world projects and then through all the experiences started learning about the differences in business outside of India and then the booming business ecosystem that was happening in India as well at that point time Flipkart was just getting started back in 2010 got gravitated back towards coming home so left the gig uh left a very hyping consulting job six figure dollar salary I'm saying this is it I want to go back and build something came back uh did my first startup which is called employee social uh which is providing rewards and recognition programs to large companies like seens baj IBM those are some of the clients that we managed ran that up until 2013 when serous leag got connected with Folks at Uber um met through an online call he told me what Uber is at that point I know what Uber was and this is remember pre Uber days in India right so Uber was just in about 20 cities in the US and the only International City they were live in at that point of time was in Paris and they looking to expand globally at that point of time and looking for their founding leader to start the Uber India business not knowing what Uber was went through a three-month long interview process with them I think that last bought 12 interviews and about four countries had to fly around many places for interviews they flew me to SF they flew me to on the FL to Singapore and India as well and then finally landed the gig to be the founding leader for Uber in India um so left my own startup because I just felt like was a lifetime you know once in a lifetime opportunity to getting a chance to build what I felt was going to be the next big thing in the country which is going to fundamentally reshape Logistics and transportation in every country in the in the city right and we all face those issues so we know what what are we talking about join duber founding leader I started off from a cafe coffee day just down the road actually V Road was my first office at Uber uh set up the entity hired the first set of people started the Uber business scaled that across the country uh pretty much all the products that you see on the Uber app whether it was back in the day Uber black down to Uber go Uber premium Uber commute Uber Moto Uber all launched by me between 2013 and 2016 and expanded across India Sri Lanka and Bangladesh with the rights business and I went back into uh building and became also the founding leader and the head of Uber Eats for India and South Asia I then built Uber Eats over the next three years um launched Uber Eats in 40 cities in India launched in Sri Lanka launched in Bangladesh and then ran that up under 2019 before Uber went IPO and then once there was a push to become profitable we were looking to exit businesses that required significant Investments moving forward and India was one of them so we end up exiting Uber Eats to zato which you may have heard of back in 2019 uh after that juste agent sorry after that free agent after a free agent I had the opportunity to move to Singapore and head Uber Eats for the APAC business somehow my heart lied in where we are today in India and F there was is so much to do here awesome so uh you know I've been following Scala story for a while right and I've seen scaler evolve from interview bit small business like we've met often right and I think one of the things that's been phenomenal is this transition that you have had from an online business during like the peak of the pandemic where nobody could do anything offline to now also building like a very very strong offline business I've seen this in a lot of other Ed teexs as well right where P I think actually it's not even edex right I think it's all startups and businesses like a Nika would do the same thing right where there's a lot of brand building that happens online there's a product that's sold online as well and then eventually they go offline what was the thought process here what's the play here I can talk about in our context right and uh there have been a very interesting Evolution over last Almost 9 years since we started so me and anjuman we started building in late 2020 uh 2014 right so now it's like just in 6 months it will be almost a decade since we started our first hypothesis as you said was Interview bit right the problem statement that we started with in early 2014 when we were figuring out that what would we want to build uh as a company that problem statement has absolutely remained the same the problem statement was that people do not a large chunk of Youth in India does not have the capability the knowledge the thinking process and skills to become very high performance high impact for the industry and both these young folks they're hardworking they're smart but they do not have a systematic way to build the skills that the industry demands industry on the other hand in a way it's bottleneck for them with the kind of talent they can hire to expand further right so we want this was the problem statement that how do we fix this gap between the two the first solution that we built was Interview bit right it was very simple our initially hypothesis was that if you build a structured curriculum which is step by step perfectly aligned to what companies are looking for right now interviews is a great reflection of that let's say if you want to hire someone in the interviews you are going to thoroughly uh drill down on that do you possess those capabilities or not right so interview bit was built as a gamified almost dual lingo for programmers where you step by step go through uh the journey you spend maybe few hours every day you do that for 6 months and if you finish the entire Journey you would have enough Knowledge and Skills where you can clear the interviews of good tech companies which it did achieve so interview b as um like I it's pretty common that on an airport or or you know in a mall someone will come and ask me that you who built interview bit right lot of people used it almost like a huge chunk of people in their final year of engineering they would use interview bit to prepare for the placements but then it had very like if I go with the intellectual honesty and ask myself that was like me and we asked ourself is interview bit solving the problem that we want to solve fully the answer was no and I'll tell you the reason with most online programs which is self-based the issue is that the completion rates are extremely low there is a study of MIT which talks about that even MIT has for example launched many of the on MIT expro I guess they've launched lot of online programs right they publicly they have just data that about only 3% of the people who start a online self-based program finish it I think it's less than that like I have this I have this one channel called Varun Maya level 2 where I did a full Unreal Engine course right both the design as well as C code right we even covered oops first episode from whatever lots of views right second last episode I still remember till today it's like 50 or 80 views or something like that it's like just 50 episodes right and people just quit like I I I started learning this I think especially in the last 3 four years that ultimately at Tech is a motivation problem it's content right and it's always been there actually if you're will stud yeah yeah it's it's always there in the books right like people say all the knowledge is on internet all the knowledge is also there in the books but the problem is that I might buy 100 books I would probably finish one of them similarly I might buy 100 courses you know online recorded courses but like most likely I would not even one of finish one of them right so we we saw the same on interviewbit as well like when we were young and stupid that we are even today but but uh we thought that you know let's let's we'll build strong gamification we'll build you know try to make strong motivation everyone goes through that by yeah yeah no you have to go through that Journey you have to go through that journey to understand the deeper problems and then figure out solutions for that right uh what we realized that even at interview bit uh if I remember the completion rates would be about 4 to 5% uh we spoke to a lot of people that uh you know why would you not complete like you know it's free it's it's you can just be at it you know that if you just keep doing it you will have a fancy job at the end of it why could you not finish right and the problem statements were very reasonable to begin Ed it's easy to just brush it off that oh people are just not motivated but it's it's deeper than that right most people they will like for example if you go to a engineering college or for that matter any University right there might be 100 things wrong about them but one good thing about a traditional College still is that there is a cohort that is studying together right in India for example if under like even B for examp example in third year he wanted to quit engineering college but he didn't if 100 people start a degree 98 of them most likely end up finishing it unless there's a extreme severe situation that comes up right now if I on the flip side online learning is mostly just studying alone right imagine that if you there's a college where you just go and sit in the whole classroom alone and there's a video that is playing in the class you will most likely drop off from that right second is if you get stuck with something if you are on a steep Learning Journey it's very natural that you can get get stuck right again if you're just alone how do you unblock that you probably have no Mentor no friend to discuss and unblock yourself with so that is how in a way idea of escaler was born right that while we like we challenged ourselves that could there be a solution which marries the scale of online but at the same time achieves the completion rates and the learning outcome of Offline that is how he Skiller was born would you argue that at least with online life is a very powerful distractor and like people just have other more important things to do and this is cognitive effort uh you know I learned this when I I don't remember which I think this was upgrad if I'm not wrong right where somebody had asked uh somebody had upgrad said that um you know it's not like a movie you can't go in Finish 50% even in a movie you can't stand up and be like give me a refund and a movie is not cogn cognitive effort you don't have to put thinking in right like the director is doing that for you but in a course especially an online course you have to put in the thinking you have to sit study learn make notes I'm watching a scaler tutor I have to figure out what he's saying finish complete the assignment there's effort on me and you know life is such a powerful dist like my washing machine is beeping you know U my girlfriend called my my mom wants me to get this everything suddenly becomes higher priority because you are doing that cognitive prioritization and it's actually lazy when you're saying this is more important than this no that's because that's how we've we've grown right when we were kids our parents took care of everything right there was no self motivation that I have to make my own bed but you know it's also a cultural thing like sometimes when I sit on my computer and I'm just learning something sometimes like my mom especially when I was younger be like no no don't do that do this like help me around the house right feels culturally bad to not help yeah and we went to school like my job is to go to school school's prob to teach me the right skills and get 10th grade and then at same philosophy to college saying now I've joined the college I did my bit now college has to make sure that I study and I graduate so we've always been groomed in such a way that we rely on someone else to keep motivating us to reach a completion self motivation extremely hard unless you have a very strong ambition and a goal post that hunger that I really want to get there because that means so much to my life so in all of this right I want to touch on something now a little bit different this is back to SST and scaler right I think we've seen a lot shift with AI I think two years ago this wasn't even a topic of conversation right we had AI but it's a very different kind of AI suddenly GPD came out you know everyone's like okay nobody has any idea what's going to happen over the next two three years and I think recently we've had Devon come out right there's been a I mean there's one thing that's very clear the Enterprise is going to be transformed okay Engineers are going to be transformed absolutely and everyone has different thoughts on it there's some people who are like software Engineers are gone right and there's some people who are like no no nothing's going to happen to software Engineers this is all this Deon is a scam then there's a middle ground that's like actually software engineering jobs are two parts one is the actual you know writing the code Code Monkey job the other job is the problem solving and the thinking of what needs to be written in the first place should I even write Cote should I use like a existing library or framework right it's more like I would say this person is a little more Junior to this person but actually if you meet a software engineer most of them have both of these combined in them and as they get more senior I think the problem solving ability goes higher and uh the decision- making ability goes higher and the uh writing code reduces because you now have a team to do it that's my thought but I know that you've probably been asked questions about de Devon 100 times now right what do you think yeah no so I think I'm a native to you know programming I like uh like I I grew like I have been writing code for 15 years today I often write code uh if I ask you this question like even when I am in a hardcore full-time developer role M what percent of time make a guess what percent of time I spend writing code yeah like 2 three hours a day but it it varies like there's some periods where you write a lot of code there's some periods where you're just like okay build like what what do we need to build in the first place so but I do agree that over time it's reduced no I can tell you that you know like the Lesser ratio between writing code versus not writing code and like important that even when I'm not writing code I am working as a software engineer enger typically for any good software engineer it is only 10 to 20% of the time when you are actually writing code yeah 80 to 90% of the time you are working as a hardcore software engineer but you are not writing code people anyone who is in a job where 80 90% they are only writing code that means they are not really working as a software engineer uh now the second part that if only 10 to 20% of the time is actually spent writing code rest of the time is actually spent figuring out what needs to be built you know a product manager would tell me that you know this is the business problem statement this is the metric that we are chasing this is the kind of product idea that we have right however then breaking it down that what needs to be built what is the most efficient way to build that that is where actual software Engineers spend most of the time right uh and even if I further take it down to you know very abstract problem statements you know data structures and algorithm for example right even there if I read a problem let's say if if if I talk about let's say 8 9 10 10 11 years back I might have given an interview and even when I coach the uh you know students at scaler that uh what is the way to have high performance even in a programming interview that when that problem is thrown at you if you jump into writing code immediately most likely you are rejected right there you have to start with first making sure that you understand the problem correctly then you build the solution then you cross verify the solution probably in a 60-minute coding interview you are supposed to spend only 5 to 10 minutes writing the code that is when it is considered a high quality interview be it Google's interview be it Microsoft interview be it Amazon's interview right that is what software Engineers really do right and then come Davin two parts to it what I feel is that one of course even D even right now is not in public betab it's it's kind of a control environment it will take years to get there but I'm optimistic it will get there where it in reality start behaving how that those demo videos uh today it is not right second is that even then what it makes is that basically it makes a software engineer maybe 5x or 10x more productive because that 20% time sometimes I might have to just write boiler plate code where I just don't have to think but I still have to write it right or I have to copy paste it from some and we've seen this with abstractions right like I used to write a lot of Ruby code in the beginning everyone's like writing authentication by themselves today nobody does that they'll just pick up a in Ruby it's called gem yeah so you just pick up a foration and you'll just be like my job's done so anyway we've seen that with abration and because a lot of code is boilerplate code now you only have to solve like the most high value important different problems than anybody else is facing but you were saying yeah so second layer you know one part is that definitely it's it is another level of abstraction if I compare with let's say even 20 25 years back people were using you know languages like Fortran like even before people used to use Punch Cards Punch Cards so these abstractions have come in right the productivity of a developer back in say 75 probably became 10x by 95 it probably became further 5x by 2015 by 2025 probably it will again increased by 4X 5x there is so much more technology to be built and then each developer can become so much more productive right this is one level right what it will mean is that it will give tools to the developers who learn these thoroughly to become much more capable second is then some people might argue that okay but that 80% thinking part the AI is developing so fast that what if it takes over on that as well right that is I think where it gets very interesting that are we saying that see the work that a software developer do in that 80% of the time is actually thinking about a lot of trade-offs different options what in watch particular real world scenario what kind of trade-offs are right to choose that's a very smart way to put it right and that is what even a CEO of the company is doing and then if we are saying that if AI gets so smart that it can replace that 70 80% thinking part that's a very different question then probably we get to a world where no one has to do anything it's not just the software developers then then probably not even the CEO doesn't have to do anything which I think becomes then a philosophical question that even whether that is even possible or not I have a theory around that I I don't think I mean companies will still have CEOs somebody still needs to be accountable and AI can't really be accountable today right and you as a CEO for example you don't have the bandwidth to sit and solve all the problems are in the company so even if an AI can do it on your behalf you'd still want somebody to allify it you might hire less Engineers but you'll still be like you're an engineer you solve whatever problem comes our way you make the decisions because I don't have the context to do 500 things a day so smaller teams but still you know more productive teams but I do think that fundamentally um business will get reshaped yeah that was my next question actually like if if all this is going to happen and your Dev suddenly become 10x more productive and they're they're able to build 10 times more things and you know your time to production is like 2 months then what happens to like a business yeah is every business a tech business in the future yes in the future every business a tech business and the business that's not a tech business will likely struggle to keep up with the growing demands of the of the consumer so I fundamentally believe that technological advancements including you know AI or geni for that matter will fundamentally reshape The Way businesses done in the future just like many of them have already changed if you just look at the journeys of all businesses that have happened over the last let's say over 100 years they've transformed every few decades because of certain new technologies that have come in whether it's Industrial Revolution that's come in whether it's new tools that have come in whether it's computers that have came in uh gadgets that came in they fundament reshaped businesses and that's likely to continue as well which is why I think like an example of a gen right as an example like you could be a business leader and today if you want to prototype something and do a little bit of AB testing in the market your current way of doing that is right now go to a team of Engineers and saying can you build these this prototype for me I want to do a Ab testing and you'll take that to the market but you're still dependent on the tech team to take bandwidth out to build this prototype for you today you're a business leader if you have a basic understanding of how jni works and how jni can help you in your business you can build a quick and dirty prototype it may not be very polished be a dirty prototype quickly take it to Market do a quick AB testing so time to Market significantly faster quick feedback then you know exactly is this working not working and now I take bandwidth from a tech team to build a product full-fledged so you what you've done is you have learned much faster you've got feedback much faster and you've used your resources a lot more efficiently than you would have otherwise have in building something that may or may not would have and now ai is going to help you do that much faster as well so fundamentally a lot of these aspects of business will change back in the day you think about marketing to be limited purely to ATL right ATL marketing then BTL marketing can you explain that for the audience so above the line marketing which is your traditional advertisements then you're below the line marketing which is kind of events that you do or you know a brand campus that you do at localized events and then you now have Performance Marketing right now future Business Leaders that are evolving in the space of marketing will have to stay a breast with all the new different devices and gadgets consumers are consuming you know I on Instagram today you and I on YouTube today we on LinkedIn today whether it's Snapchat or many more that will come and there be different gadgets and different tools are keep coming as well as a marketing person I need to know where are my consumers and what are they using and what algorithms these platforms have for me to Target this consumer properly would you argue and you know this is something I'm picking up from what you're saying would you argue that it's getting easier and easier especially with Gen to build products but it's getting harder to get users would you argue that or do you think that both are equally important and you're trying to you know yeah I think both are equally important I think both are solving two different problems all together right here what J is doing is helping you in business decision- making take products faster to Market learn quickly before you build a full product an example or build components of but if everyone else can do that then your marketing costs by by Supply demand and hence this is where you have to become smarter as a marketer right who is my audience how do I get a better understanding of my consumer preferences how do I then Target that user and the using the right Channel with the right Roi with the right uh you know in in and you have Ro in in marketing terms well how do I get that and which platform do I use to get that out as well which is why I think future Business Leaders will not need to just be a business leader and know the core fundamentals of business but we'll also need to know the advancements and Technologies really well like I don't imagine a business leader of the future of a large scale business in India or anywhere for that matter not having understanding of how technology works because they don't they're not going to be efficient but those who do will be 10x more efficient and applying the technology to grow the business faster at scale and do you feel it's going to be disconnected from time like in the sense today you want to do more things you need to spend more amount of time right but I think with like my personal opinion of the is maybe we'll work 2 days 3 days it's more about now effective decision making and that's what I was telling about Twitter as well right like effective decision making has disappeared because most people are now going with whatever the public thinks is correct or wrong correct and that in real life businesses it's almost all wrong yeah right do you feel like effective decision making it's not about running the ad yourself right at some point Facebook will like I think Facebook already kind of automatically runs ads but what to run and why the the how rather than and the the why rather than the how you feel the why has become more important absolutely absolutely 100% And I think which is why if I just go back to and just connecting back a little bit to what we're doing at scaler also you know the entire thesis behind scaler School of Business that we're just launching right now which is a 18-month program um the entire thinking behind that is to teach you by making you do things so this aspect ECT about effective decision making uh the why behind it learning consumer preferences then applying technology to take your product to Market so how do you think of a business idea how do you take from concept to reality then how do you build an MVP then how do you reach out to Consumers generate Revenue know what the business fundamentals are going to be and what the economics are going to be and then go and Pitch it to a VC do you give do you give uh the students in ad budget so yeah as part of the project right so when they when they're building a project what they end up doing is so we have something scaler Innovation lab which is on campus itself that's a shared space between our students from SST scal Sol technology and scal solo business nice so it's like a vinator it's like a V com inov exactly and what what you basically have is business students collaborating with Tech students almost you have your in-house Tech team design team and your marketing team in some way I think rocket Labs is the better this good example yeah good parall out there as well students come together work on an MVP in The Innovation lab itself build that product take it to Market maybe take a marketing budget start getting some Revenue out of it so the tech guy tells the marketing guy you will get users and the marketing guy says I trust that you'll be able to build the product and we'll take it to Market not only that Scala will then bring top VCS and investors in a room and the value prop in this is when these two are talking to each other like the developer in the market here all the usual problems of startups are going to start appearing right like one gu that guy said he'll be here today he wasn't here and no Theory can teach you that thing is no traditional Business program no books no Theory can teach you any of that stuff conflict conflict right what up when you're there and you're building it yourself in the middle of the action or you're taking a real world project let's say I get you a project from to give example at skill so technology we have projects that we are doing with some pretty large startups like I think some of the names we can take is like Zolo as an example Urban company recently a project for the government of India bashini project when you take that project you start building it you start realizing the complexity of building it the you can study right you never get the understanding of what it takes to build it real time now imagine Business Leaders while in the B school doing this with in collaboration building the product and taking to Market all the real problems is this even a problem does the customer want this solution that you try to sell right uh taking quick feedback iterating on the product very quickly going back to the consumer again taking feedback itting quickly right managing customer support then marketing for it sales for it and then how the pnl comes together and then taking this should be very hard to pull off offline on online can't be done online like I would say so far I have not figured out how how it could be done especially like you showed me a video of that Hardware thing right where people are building that right right fire fighting drones yeah very tough to pull like five people together make them ship burning them burning the midnight oil s together in the classroom ideating on a whiteboard together prototyping quickly try it out on the ground come back again prototype again righted on the ground why aren't traditional colleges doing this it like traditional colleges are also fairly smart I mean and there's a lot of revenue for them to lose right like I don't know why they're just like letting the opportunities slip uh my thesis is I think it's a quality of professors right if you get somebody who's been successful 20 years ago many of these professors haven't even been successful they've just been teaching all throughout right so uh why do you think they they've not caught up to the opportunity I'll give my three reasons maybe we can add later I the first you already touched upon I think the fact that they limits El to professors who come with strong theoretical backgrounds or research backgrounds unfortunately have not spent time in Industry so theyve not been there done that the big difference that we want to make sure with both the School of Technology and the School of Business is to make sure that every part of the program is developed moderated and even delivered in some cases by industry leaders themselves so for example if you're doing a case study and let's say the case study is about logistics or transportation for that matter can an existing leader of uber India come on campus and review your case study and your outcome and then basis that maybe even offer you PPI right there itself that real experience does not happen so that's number one because the professors that you have come from more Theory and research versus but why don't they have the access they either limited and that's my second point right so they're either limited by um the aspect of evolution that I I need to evolve right because I'm not being challenged so the complacency kicks in and that was my second point I think complacency plays a big role I've been around for 30 40 years it's been working the way it's been working I've been getting students the way they're coming right now ofes a year I'm getting thousands of croses every year what do you missing out right now is business is evolving so rapidly technology is evolving so rapidly that unless you're able to get those students up and running outside I mean look at the stats out out there right now whether it's engineering stats whether it's MBA stats employability of every single graduate is questioned right I mean you have terrible stats right now one out of four MBA students are employable right one out of 10 engineering students students are employable the reason for that is because you're not learning from the industry you're not staying up up to speed of the industry complacency and third is the curriculum itself the curriculum itself does not go through significant ramp see the cost of constantly changing the curriculum and hence bringing new professors who can deliver that from the industry is very high it's not low cost it's pretty high right some of the colleges are not able to understand the how do we keep evolving the curriculum and bringing the right quality to keep teaching that so they're stuck in that same curriculum that's been prescribed and running the way it is like even today if you go to some of the engineering college for that matter they still make you do mechanical filing in the first of engineering I did that yeah you're a c student yeah I did Le and all that yeah right I mean if you go today to a business school for that matter you're still stuck in learning the four Ps and the 3c's yeah world has moved far beyond that sure you need to know the four Ps and 3c's so you have to have the understanding of the cord business fundamentals but unless you've taken that and applied it in your period of there when you Expos to the real world suddenly happens especially conflict you can't teach conflict you can't teach organization management I mean think about how the companies are going to be structured in the future with the ad of AI a lot of the company structuring is going to change right customer support as a function is going to change sales enablement as a function is going to change right uh so how do you stay in touch with that a lot of Legacy institutions are not able to keep up with it versus I think the new age programs are coming in business programs or tech programs and I think that's where I think we want to be at the Forefront for both with technology School of Technology and the School of Business is to ensure we're constantly evolving our curriculum so we are very uh adaptable tomorrow after a year a new technology comes in which becomes very critical for our students to learn we're able to incorporate that almost immediately so we are always preparing you for the future hence when you graduate you are still relevant for the next decade or more versus what's happening in traditional colleges you graduate you're still relevant for the last decade not even for the current time unfortunately there's also a very very strong like test prep market right that that actually it's like I I can see the complete picture now right like there's a college that you end up obviously the the Highlight colleges the iits or like nits or whatever they're on top and bits and whatnot right and then there's like a tail end of colleges that you know can go from sort of good to like you know just real estate company where you're paying rent uh I feel like to enable that there's now like a test prep race there are a bunch of exams and the exams are like sort of regulated so you know there's no scam going on there but the test prep thing I feel is like very unregulated I've also seen that you were telling me it has sort of lottery ticket Dynamics right can you explain that for us like how does it work if I if I start with some numbers right uh every year about 1.5 million 15 lakhs people uh buy the J form fill it and then I think about 2.2 million to 2.2 million people who buy neat form and then if I go to higher education about 3 300,000 three lakh people who buy cat form and fill it all right well India is a country of scale right these are the kind of numbers which when I talk to my friends in in Europe and us like like holy cow like what kind of numbers are you talking about that a single exam on a single day or maybe spread across two days two million people are going to write that exam right uh so in India I think that thing does exist similar thing also exists for upsc for example right that there would be few hundred people who are going to get selected and few million who are in that race uh India is of course a developing country right and uh second layer of interesting uh stats and distribution I can talk about if you on the Google Trends search about that in which area is the high search frequency of terms let's say upsc you will see that it is inversely proportional to the per capita GDP of the state highest search density of upsc is in Bihar in Rajasthan while in Gujarat maharash Tamil Nadu the sear frequency of theem will be much lower right so these test prep exams kind of become a kind of only ladder for Upward social mobility in areas where are no other opportunities a Gujarati 70 17 18 20 year old kid would say I don't need to be in that rat race there are so many plenty of opportunities around me if I put that much hard work there I would have a fantastic career you know B probably you would have never given IIT J uh fun fact I don't know what jwe was when I was staring Engineering in Bombay I know what JW was me on the other hand where I come from because in my Village there is no other way for me to you know kind of do anything for me preparing for J or preparing for NDA was the most important thing when I was in school right so I think that first is that that is the only kind of upward social Mobility right now when we talk about this the level of competition that exists now let's say if I the numbers are so so crazy if I simplify let's say there are a million people writing an exam and if I want to study in a top Institute in India computer science then my all India rank need to be more like thousand or so right when I went to Tri Hyderabad I was in that range now thousand top thousand rank out of a million people who are writing the exam is 99.9 percentile it's as much as almost winning a lottery right now if I want to win this Lottery there are two levels of ticket that I have to buy the first level is of course I have to buy the 1,500 rupe k j form fill it what a business right and just 15 15 1.5 million into even 1,000 rupees right that's $150 million if I am doing the math right uh or 15 million uh the second part is then that is one you know that's one opportunity the other is then comes to the coaching institutes because just having bought the form is just entry into the raffle now to really increase any odds then you want to maybe either do a coaching and then second level when coaching is a very high effort right uh the second level is that you know there are let's say uh 5,000 6,000 rupe app program that you can buy now the fascinating number is that about 1.1 1.5 million people every year buy those as well if you might as well buying the farm you might as well buy it yeah you're buying a 2,000 rupe form so maybe you buy a 6,000 rupe course and maybe you get lucky and maybe you get lucky right if you look at the completion rates or real outcome of those it will be even less than 1% that's all just impulse buy you know like it's just like you're buying the lottery ticket and you're hoping that maybe it will happen but you know it's actually worse than buying a lottery ticket because like we've discussed in the previous in in the beginning right some of those people competing against you out of that 2 million 10 million whatever the number is Right are freaks of motivation the freaks of nature you just can't see it in their muscles or their body you can it's it's in their brain and they will sit burn the Midnight Oil till like they don't sleep they sleep like 4 hours and and that's why and it's also like uh if you if you watch some of these movies right like 12th fail and all there'll always be like one or two characters who are like freaks of motivation who get by in the first round right but I feel like the entire this is so hard to kill in India like test prep simply because there's just so much money made it's it's illogical to to kill it I think what I see is it's a cultural and also socioeconomic Evolution that will happen uh the reason for example there is not a huge test prep Market in Gujarat because there is so many opportunities in business right even in us for example if I take another extreme example in us while almost all the kids give SAT but there is no huge s coaching business there people prepare they study they give an attempt they get some marks they figure it out not having scored great in s would never be cause of making a kid Sude or you know even think about that my life life is over unfortunately in our country it it becomes so much that you know maybe make movies around few hundred th000 kids would feel that if I do not scale well SC score well enough in J then my life is over I'm a failure for life and that's the biggest that someone can believe in right but but the society makes that happen yeah the paral pressure and so and the movies and the movies yeah well fail yeah no and I think one thing that I would emphasiz is that get one clearing or not clearing exams working hard for them definitely worthy like it's respectable thing but thinking that result of that exam is going to Define your life is is absolutely not right unfortunately a lot of our web series and I think movies Etc sometimes they are even funded by the businesses which benefit by the you know coaching industry but I think that sets that uh theme in the whole society and that's why you feel because it's like it's making so much money it's like very hard to disrupt it right like and the minute you charge too much uh I know that for example with SSB right like with skill school business and even SST they're reasonably much more expensive than going and doing one of these but I feel like a lot of people will anchor you to that price in a way they'll be like the other course is like 5,000 rupees right to get into a competitive exam or to whatever why is yours so much more expensive they get the offline part and all and they understand there's some you know uh extra expense for that but why is it so much more expensive without understanding that the completion rates are there are quite low if my understanding is correct right I think the difference is between whether you are buying a lottery ticket or are you really you know kind of investing into your learning and you know real outcomes it's almost like a probabilistic odds right you have to multiply the 6,000 rupees into 1% to see the to see the real price real price of that you actually have to divide it by 1% to see the real price and also I think two other aspects to it one is that you're also investing and having an experience that was will stay you with you for much longer right your your test prep done results come done I know it's an unfair comparison but that's an unfair comparison right but you're talking about a program let's say you take the skills Business program now in those 18 months while you're investing 20 lakh in fee in that 18 months the experience that you're gaining interacting with industry leaders having top CEOs come on the campus talk to you having you know case studies that are being um doctored and and reviewed by indust leaders themselves build building a product while you're on the campus um pitching to top vs and investors that experience that you're pretty much cramping in a 80- Monon period is now going to benefit you for many decades to come that exam that you just did was a onetime at that point of time requirement of a successor failure that you had this experience now stays with you for the next many decades so that when you transform yourself from maybe just a average associate in a particular company to a manager or a senior manager or move up or pivot or maybe become a Founder for that matter and start your own company you know a lot of students when you think about at least the program at SSB we think about students that are going to come in are likely going to have three parts are they going to Pivot which they'll change the field that they're in maybe they're in the in the tech field but they want to go to consulting or marketing or they're going to build they become Founders right or they're going to grow which means they go from like a marketing associate let's say Performance Marketing Manager irrespective of the path you're going to take the learning that you going to have have cramped in that 18 months is going to stay with you for decades and and like I go back even today to some of the things I learned back in during my B school days right and okay this is what I learned back then this is still useful for me out here now so it's obviously unfair comparison to test prep in general but when you're spending that amount you're spending it for the experience the exposure and completion rate like main thing is completion right like it's so easy to quit any of these things that is like just having some some peer pressure there and people there saying finish finish finish is a very big deal I mean and of course there's one additional aspect to which is Roi right if I'm spending that 18 months and spending 20 lakh rupees what I'm expecting is an outcome of it what are the outcomes I assume there are jobs at the end yeah yeah so I mean like I said I think you know there are tech jobs and the non- tech jobs both open up as avenues for you after you complete this pgp and management technology here so for example if you go for non-tech jobs like I said you could be a marketing associate you want to become a Performance Marketing Manager you're a sales associate you want to become an Enterprise sales manager now these are typically significant jumps in your in your salary as well right I mean those can not pay you as much as 30 lakh rupees or higher in some of these positions you want to maybe go into becoming a category manager for an e-commerce company or for for the other maybe you want to switch over to a startup and join the Founder's office as Chief of Staff so you need to have understanding of strategy but you need to understand also all the different facets of business because in the Founder's office you need to know the entire business by itself right and all the different facets of it uh or for that matter maybe you want to switch over to um in the tech side of it I want to become an engine ing manager or a product manager or a technical Pro program manager so this program what it's supposed to do to you is give you this 18mon experience of applying all your Concepts in the real world expose you to the industry and land you to a position where you either want to Pivot or you want to grow or you want to build you know I've seen this in my own Behavior Uh at least when we hire people right like 3 4 years ago you know to hire for a business role like we were very unclear we' just look at a resume and we'd see whatever right today but we hire a lot from alt mbas we don't we still don't hire too much from traditional mbas because we feel they're far behind the curve but especially alt mbas we've had a good experience of hiring a few people in fact one of the guys who runs one of our units is like damn good and he's from one of the alt mbas in fact that's the next question right like there are some of these popping up now yep I think there's you guys there's Master Union there's sta there's a bunch of others how do you differentiate versus them yeah um I'll take a stab first please jump in but so I think firstly I think all of them are good in their own aspects right they all are the safe answer no no I I'll answer uh further down also right like see ultimately what they're doing is they all have they all have understood there's a gap which is very evident yeah which traditional colleges are not able to fulfill because the skill requirements of the industry and the skills imparted during your time on campus that I agree with are far apart and H they all have identified their uh the difference and they say okay we want to play a role in minimizing that Gap as possible so they all addressing it different so one I think they all have own kind of strategy for it in that aspect just like how you were for traditional MBA programs you would probably say for if I want to specialize in HR here has a college that I think is better if I want to go for finance I will likely end up choosing a college in Bombay right like nursing good example if you want to go Finance as an example if I want to specialize for example in operations and strategy maybe there's an MBA college that I have reference towards same also will happen to the alt mbas or the New Age MBA programs that are coming so they start specializing in specific specializing now each one will play their own kind of Advantage right what we fundamentally believe and why we got motivated was launching skills full of business is fundamental belief is that future Business Leaders will need to have an understanding of how technology Works got it so that's why the SST like that's why the fact that SSB is on the SST campus and the collaboration happens which is why industry leaders come in grade you on that as well give you case studies to work on that as well you work on a project and we also include things like deep analytics now future Business Leaders will need to know how deep analytics works so when we say Tech enabled curriculum we're not talking about coding here you don't need to have prior coding experience you don't need to be from the tech background nor will we teach you coding in MBA program we are still going to focus on the core fundamentals of business Theory as well as practical across all facets with an industrial advantage of a tech part because one we are Tech Pioneers we've done that before Future Leaders will need to know Tech technology that's a given actually there's an interesting observation that I think AB should Shar about we were discussing this in the car on the way here about businesses in top 20 businesses in the US China versus India maybe he'll talk about that in a bit but incorporating this entire skill inovation lab teaching you deep analytics and tools required for analytics or you teaching you how to use genni to do a quick prototyping and dirty AB testing are important aspects what are future Business Leaders going to require and that's why we want to bring bring in skill SCH of business because I think we are uniquely positioned compared to all the other names that you mentioned because we have this Innovation lab we have skill technology You' be more like a tech uh business sort of hybrid yeah we are at the cusp or the intersection of business technology because that's where we believe all the business Trends are evolving and some interesting observations you want to talk about no so it's a very interesting thing that U I think India is like I'm very bullish on India for various reasons that maybe later I can talk about and as as right now it's election going on uh so you know like there is a very clear mandate and kind of directional set that India is going to be 30 trillion economy right now if you look at there is us which is already ahead of that there's China which is getting there uh I strongly believe that in in maybe in few decades India will get there as well now if you look at that what kind of now this 30 trillion economy or a 50 trillion economy is primar driven by the organizations the private companies which are kind of scaling fast right if you look at top 10 or 20 companies in us more than half of them are technology companies right if you s if you look at China if you look at top 20 companies more than half like at least 30 40% of them are already technology companies and it is very clearly predicted that in next another 5 seven years more than half of them will be technology companies like hell I think top five are all technology companies in us right in India on the flip side right now if we look at it if you look at top 10 or 20 companies in India none of them probably are technology companies today now this 30 trillion economy Journey that is is going to happen it is bound to come from very large technology companies being created now who builds these companies right in us as well if you look back at if you go back time machine and if you look at that what were the top companies in 1960 1970 it was very similar to what India has today most of them maybe an oil company maybe a Transport company maybe a career company maybe a bank right now you need a Eric Smith to build Google right found might do 0 to 1 1 to 10 but you need these people who live at the strong intersection of the cusp of technology and management I mean Uber is another good example of that Founders are great at 0 to one but they're not very good at build Uber but D is the one who made it you know a very profitable Large Scale company uh Google was built by the two Founders L page at um that's like crazy random energy they did fantastic 0 to11 to10 but then Eric Smith came in and then built Google to put on the path of a trillion dollar company right India would need a lot of such you know management talent but do you think it's not the founders in many cases like I've noticed this a lot and in in some cases it is Zuckerberg is still there right in some cases it is but I think it's because the understanding that both have to go hand in hand you can't be only a technology person and not understand what organizational culture is how do I motivate teams how do I manage my people what kind of divers diversity do I require what does diversity inclusion really mean if I look at marketing what are the different facets of marketing how consumer behavior is changing you're still in The Silo of the tech world you're still seeing code around you you're seeing apps around you you're still seeing new technology around you but you're losing perspective of what the consumer out there is actually looking for if you're only business you're essentially thinking of business always the way it was traditionally done right and you're losing on the aspect of again how technology can advance business much faster make me 10x more efficient so fun to belief and that's why I'm seeing uh difference between some of the other MBA programs that you spoke about and and why we still went ahead with launching Skill School of Business and looking for this founding cohort is because of this fundamental belief and after serving the entire Market we realize that we are the ones who are uniquely positioned to offer this unfair advantage that we have because we have skill SCH technology because we are Tech Pioneers because we have skill Innovation lab and because we are as a company and the program is designed by folks who' been and done large businesses I I ran Uber Builder to a billion dollars you have Manish pansari who's a senior executive at Scala he was the XCX on mintra uh leading operations to $400 million of minra Alan you ABI Manu and Animan who build businesses that are worth $700 million right now at Scala so when you have people at the helm of this supported by some of the biggest names in Industry whether is dender goyal or B bansel or Rajan anandan you essentially get getting an industry together to build this program and then the unique advantage that you can have and what the benefit you can give the students only multiplying compounds from there no I think that's that's pretty fascinating and I think I mean I can now see I was I was a little bit of a skeptic but I can now see the advantage that comes from having SST and SSB on the same campus right if you come into my company already having managed Engineers that's already a big win mhm right whereas it would be very hard to hire somebody who's not had that experience and get them in I'd have to look for a employee at a company who's done that previously had like few years of workx and brought that person in so there's no fresher market for this what you're talking about and I think I can see that it potentially evolves is this for like young students or is this like for people who are already working professionals one job and two jobs in who's it for yeah I mean I think we expect almost about 80 to 90% of our class to be made up of folks who are already working and looking for this shift that I spoke about either they want to build they want to grow or they want to Pivot uh so I expect 80 to 90% of our classroom to be experienced folks who've done one or two jobs have understood post their bachelors and undergraduate that I require business skills and these are gaps I have you won't usually understand the gaps you have unless you've been in the business yourself and experien that okay you know what this is what I'm lagging behind and now a b b school program can help me so usually it's always better coming into a pgb program with some years experience having said that I do expect about 10 to 20% of our classroom to be potentially be freshers but then they have to be exceptional either exceptional academics or strong achievements in any olympiads potentially have done you know amazing projects in the past maybe already been a Founder while they were you know in college kind of building stuff and tinkering stuff um so I think we want the diversity also right uh diversity in form of gender diversity in form of of course experiences backgrounds of gender like what what's your goals see I think fundamental belief again uh and I'm a product of that myself is that when you have diversity in gender as well your learning experiences increase exponentially uh not just because you meet like-minded people and from both genders on campus that you can interact with uh you know get to know uh but you also get different perspectives which are often missed out in fact that's why there's enough stats out there that suggest that leadership uh teams that are diverse typically are more productive take better decisions and have a higher market cap than those leadership teams that don't have any diversity okay I have one last question for you important question right like I think ultimately if somebody's spending 20 lakhs or 30 lakhs or 40 whatever it is right I think there will be this added burden of not burden but a responsibility of giving them a job so what's the what's the placement Network like who are the people that are involved uh what kind of companies can people expect I think that last end of the education process I want to know from you know both both SST as well as SSB I know that because scalers been around for a while and I know you guys have like a good set of recruiters you have relationships and one thing we have learned is that it's a very relationship driven business right like do you know the person can you call him up and say Hey you know these five guys are really good you should interview them uh and there also needs to be somebody on ground batting for you right some placement person who's sitting talking to your person saying you know I'll talk to the recruiter extra okay I'll figure it out so how does that process work like what can people expect so like you said skill has been around for a while right and through this entire Journey uh of the online business that we had Skiller Academy and Skiller dsml we basically got a chance to place our students in own 900 companies across India and globally name the top tech companies in the country and chances you're going to find a Skiller Al there already now what that does is it helps us continue maintaining relationships with all those n plus companies who are already rooting and batting for us in fact back couple of years ago scaler Academy ended up placing more students into Amazon than all the ID combined so we've already buil credibility with employers along with that our own placement team which is more than 50 people by the way so it's a pretty large placement Team all the 50 people kind of working on a placement team maintain relationships with these 900 plus companies on an ongoing basis right looking for opportunities looking for what are they looking for in terms of skills right how do I make sure that I invite these companies on campus so for example at SST since we spoke about SST as well within one year we've had I don't know by now over 15 to 16 companies come on campus and do presentations already you're talking about basically one company every two weeks is coming on campus and doing presentations for our students for them for the student to join yes for students to join just employer branding what do they do what do they do what kind of work is it what can you expect when you join us what skills are required what skills be assess for so students know what to prepare for that same network carries forward to skill of School of Business as well so you have a large placement team you have existing relationship with large number of employers already besides that you also have a strong Network now we are funded by Peak 15 light Ro they help us over Network my background I have a reach of certain companies ABI Manu has a certain reach of companies Anum mandas and we all take it upon ourselves as our own personal kpis and and kras right it's my own personal kpi to make sure that every single student of scal of School of Business gets placed or every student skill technology gets placed in a job that they would want to get placed in with as high probability as possible if I can impart the but you can't place 100% of students there'll always be one guy who just stops coming to college or whatever right I think driving adherence of course students effort is necessary if someone just says that you know I'm not going to do anything then probably we'll say that you know this is not the right place for you you can just maybe leave the campus right uh but as of even as of today for example in every single class of schar school of techn SCH School of Technology we see at least 90% attendance and again it's rooted a lot in the culture right when there are hundred kids who are all passionate about it even two who might be feeling little bit you know I'm not really feeling that up but when everyone else is doing so much the probability of that reduces right now what I do understand is that more for Skill School of Technology people will discover a lot of things they will evolve in different ways someone might say that let's say I want to build a avionx company I don't want to be a data scientist I want to maybe build you know maybe defense drones or I want to you know kind of set up a startup or I want to do freelancing right we would rather encourage them to explore different kind of paths in their life right uh and that is why the you know the the hope and dream to build a v combinators like thing in India through Innovation lab right so people will take their different paths as long as there is rigor as long as there there is curiosity so for example at in our schar school ecosystem we have this concept of Rise right which is our ice which is like respect Integrity curiosity and Excellence I think these last two curiosity and Excell L as long as that is integrated like see you are not in a job I am not in a job but I think we are doing decent enough uh for the world around yeah I think the goal is not 100% employ like 100% placements the goal is 100% outcomes of what the students desire yeah if they want to be an entrepreneur they if 95% want a job they get a job if 5% want to go become entrepreneur they get become entrepreneur maybe some of them even want to maybe go pursue Masters or PhD if they really choose to or I want to go abroad and maybe just Tinker with something have that option our goal is can we provide 100% outcomes of what you desire interesting I have one last question for both of you guys and this is more like a rapid fire type of question right which is one counterintuitive Insight you have had about students which nobody will agree with you on and which you don't want to tweet about from each of you um yeah I don't know if it's if it's very counterintuitive or not uh but I do see that students today are far less satisfied with their own achievements than I think you and I used to be I think even a small win for you and I we would celebrate that a lot and I think social media is playing a role in students feeling that I need to do more constantly so this this constant belief that I'm not happy yet and I'm not good enough I'm not good enough yet I'm not I'm not satisfied yet which actually works sometimes in their favor of just pushing harder working harder and getting better results also it's like the pure pressure environment you're creating in SSB that's almost playing out on social media it's like oh Elon has done this other thing again now I got now I have to do my next project at least yeah see the reality is the world is getting more competitive the reality is that the requirements of what it takes from Individual to be more successful is is getting higher as well than what it used to be before um and counter to what you and I think sometimes that you know maybe youth today is traveling a lot more they're more privileged they watch more movies they spend more they have these expensive gadgets you know they far more privilege than you and I used to be like for me getting a cricket ball to play weight of 10 rupees or to like argue with my dad for like 10 minutes to get 10 rupes to buy a cricket ball Dr could play with today we believe they're privileged but counter to I think what social media also says they don't take this privilege for granted they are actually realizing that they're privileged and hence added pressure that are now I'm privileged I have to do more yeah what would you I think starting with the the the learning mindset of the students right so often education system is very geared towards in a way if I may say beating the Fallen that the students who are not performing well it is immediately labeled that they are you know they are just not motivated enough they're not hardw workking enough etc etc uh what I feel is that generally that is always rooted in uh the education system not being able to generate the Curiosity in them the moment let's say I have to teach a subject let's say I want to teach students how to you know let's say uh build applications you know let's say I want to teach them front-end engineering or backend engineering one way of taking the classes that I go teach them there's a lecture being given they're supposed to take notes then there's an exam going to happen and then I'll say that oh these people are just not motivated you know none of them are really doing anything and when you flip it over the moment you give them high agency you give them that what do you want to build you know and why should you build that right and then you give them like in the way you invert it that now you want to build it figure out how you could build it and I'm there to support you someone says that let's say I want to build a multiplayer game you know they where let's say there are four players who can just play this online from four different locations and then you probe them there's this Socrates method of teaching right that you ask question how would that happen how would four computers who are sitting across four different part of the world communicate with each other then you introduce there's a concept called socket programming to do that right then the learning changes massively but I think the counter counterintuitive thing here is that you have to trust the students and you just have to build curiosity in them and let them be you have to do what they are interested in not what the curriculum is right right right you figure out and maybe first responsibility of the teacher is just to get them interested in into something and once that happens give them a lot of freedom and be their support to keep walking that path you feel the reason a lot of these students fail then according to you is because they also pick the wrong streams then absolutely or or even the stream they are in they never know why is this important how is this relevant I can talk about myself in my school I was a good student I was super hardworking hopefully decent enough at brains as well I would solve the hardest of the problems in differentiation and integration but until I went to college I never knew what is the Practical of use of it the moment I realized oh integration could be used for so many industrial applications differentiation could be used for so many physics problems right it was a kind of mindblown moment for me if I was explained that in 10th class I would have enjoyed learning differentiation and integration so much more so you're saying it's poor quality teachers throughout throughout all the way from first class to you know like having finished the engineering would you argue that like people who have not done anything useful in life go and end up being teachers oh oh controversal I'll tell you very controversial but uh at least I can talk about my journey right and this is this is actually a fact in most premium institutes as well the people who couldn't end up with anything else most of them would end up becoming associate professors at private universities that's a fact yeah I think and and that's why I think one of the core principles behind building the scale of school both the School of Technology in School of Business is we are not getting your typical traditional you know theoretical writing on blackboard professors right these are individuals who have voted in the industry before they've for SST for example they've been VP of engineering at snap deal or they've been a senior engineer in one of the top tech companies fundamentally believe in the mission statement of skill technology that we need to revamp Tech education in the country and hence I have a passion for teaching the next generation of Builders because I want to create the next Su Pai or the next from India so they've left their jobs come on SK uh to skills technology and teaching here same host for skill scho of business as well right uh and which is why industry leaders associating themselves scaler campus for both the technology and School of Business yeah the only problem with getting like really good people to teach is it becomes very expensive because the smartest people wouldn't come work with you and hence the pricing of a program right to some extent is not on the lower end either it's not super expensive either right it's not the low end either right it's priced at a point to allow us to bring such C teachers to you so that your experience is not compromised in that four years of skill of SCH technology or in those 18 months of the School of Business your second Insight you had one more insight the other one is I think more on um the Collaborative Learning part right again often a common belief in India has been that you know that the unstructured time people spending together is unproductive people often say right but within scal campus that what I see is again it's it's a function of the right culture right students of course you know they are learning a lot in the classroom but I do see that lot more learning also happens outside of the classroom which be could be happening just in their hostel rooms it could be happening in The Innovation lab it could be happening in the just on the ground and some people chitchatting I think just few days the night I was in the campus and some of the kids were trying out their drone they're doing the test flight of the Drone they are building right all of this is unstructured It's just exploration discovery iterations which is not curriculum bound but I think this unstructured exploration is a very very powerful thing and which the impact of that the Whiteboard of course yeah and the third I think another counterintuitive Insight that I so also feel is more related to the selection process I think the selection process like with all humility I would say and I think that's the case with most institutes which Produce High Impact leaders it's not for everyone uh it does not mean that the person we are having to say NO2 is not capable it just means that scalar School of Technology or scalar School of Business might not be the right fit for them it might not be the best environment for them it's not one siiz fits all right I had this experience um so after school of course I was attempting trying to get through J into a good college and NDA right getting into National Defense Academy and he also has very this very interesting thing very very steep selection criteria and on day Zero of your service selection board these are all 17 18 year old young kids who are going for service selection board five day long interview process right and the commandant on Day Zero will tell this that NDA is not for everyone the selection does not mean that there's a linear St ranking and only the best one gets in it simply means that there is a particular shape of the whole in which a particular shape of the people fit perfectly you not fitting into that does not mean you are not good it simply means that the Institute is meant for a particular goal has a particular ecosystem which is best fit for a particular kind of people I think at s we follow that very yeah I think Shameless plug in here but I think for those who are watching this podcast I would say that applications for both skills of business and skill technology is currently open right we are looking for a founding cohort at skill of School of Business which classes commence in August I think when you apply you'll experience the the do you feel some people might feel bad their OS might get hurt if you reject them cuz this happens a lot no no that's what I want to emphasize very strongly yeah that it's a particular kind of program with a very particular kind of goal in mind rejection does not mean that you are bad it simply means an again the selection is a deep science it can never be perfect it just that that the measurement that we have today feels it's not the best place for you yes it's not right fit for you or the program is not right for your requirements and your expectations so which is what like you know I think when you go through one of the applications through us you kind of experience some of the differences or nuances that we've brought into the process itself of the selection to ensure that we handpick the right students for the experience I was talking about earlier as well um yeah but I think if you go the traditional way of just writing a comparative exam you know studying day and a night for it uh you're likely to end up with a cohort that those who don't make it will feel they're not capable enough and those who make it were anyway like you said the the freaks of nature in many ways they'll do well anyways right uh but they may not be the most cohesive uh set of students who will add value to the program or the program will add value to them for us that's the most important emphasis that I want to I want to drive here that our entire application process that we have currently ongoing for both the programs is driven towards this can the students add value to the program and can the program add value back to the students lovely this is a very insightful conversation I learned a lot about education I learned a lot about offline education uh it isn't as simple as it seems uh at least from The Outsiders View and congratulations on you know doing SSB and I think scaler you know I've been following for very very long time every time I speak to you I get new insights about in general everything from test prep to like how education like how is it evolving and we've all seen it evolve like 10 years ago it was something very different now it's something very different I'm also pretty excited to see you know how you guys integrate AI into you know at least the usage of the tools into uh the program I want to see how that impacts Business Leaders right like interesting to see how business people will use uh AI so I think um yeah congratul on launching this and I you know hopefully I'm able to hire some people from you know the the next batch or the batch after that and contribute in some way thank you so much bye"}

{"video_id": "3l7LyS1QAOk", "title": "Are Software Engineering Jobs Dead?", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l7LyS1QAOk", "transcript": "a new AI tool was released recently called the devil wait did we get that wrong I'm just kidding it's called Devon and it scared the holy ghost out of software developers all over the world made by cognition Labs Devon is the new state-of-the-art on the swe bench coding Benchmark and successfully passed practical engineering interviews from leading AI companies and even completed real jobs on the freelancing platform upwork they pitch it as the world's first fully autonomous AI software engineer enger the blog States Devon is a tireless skilled teammate equally ready to build alongside you or independently complete task for you to review so let's do it like this first let's go through everything that they solve and then I'll tell you from my experience of building a slightly similar tool last year on how I think the software engineering job might evolve yes I do not think software engineering jobs are completely going to disappear I do think they will evolve so I want to give you my thoughts but first let's see what Devon can do number one cognition lab states that Devon can solve problems in unfamiliar technologies that it has no exposure to which means it can read documentation and make decisions this is not actually a surprise because gp4 can do this too at least for problem statements of small context length number two is that Devon can make apps end to endend if you give Devon an app idea it will solve it for you including planning out all the features and edge cases it even writes tests for you but you know what again GPD 4 can kind of do this for you the third is that Devon is not actually foolproof it does make mistakes but it's also fully capable of debugging the code also if you give it a GitHub issue and the code base it can get to solving it again GPD 4 can do this too and almost a year ago we had self-healing code that on the back of GPD 4 could write some code and then if that code produces a bug you can enter that as a bug to GPT and GPT will tell you how to solve it next not only that Devon can also contribute to mature production repositories in this example Devon solves a bug with logarithm calculations in the simpai python algebra system Devon sets up the code environment reproduces the bug and then codes and test the fix on its own according to their blog GPD can't do this yet because it needs something else to help it to push to GitHub directly now the question you may be asking here is well vun GPT seems to do a lot of this and we do know GPT wres code but why doesn't it make full apps properly yet well that's because GPT has ADHD it has attention deficiency and it constantly gets sidetracked when you use it as an agent and that is the entire reason the technology qar was all over Twitter a few months ago because it helps GPT plan better GPT is pretty bad at reasoning and planning especially over long sequences and I want to explain exactly how because I have some amount of experience with this if Devon has actually solved this there are far more implications than just code and it also means that Devon need not have to build their own llm at all they are completely comfortable working on top of GPT or claw okay now before I continue I want to tell you why I am even a competent person to explain this to you or explain the implications sometime over the last year we built a tool called autocode Pro we actually built it as an experiment it was an AI agent to help you write entire apps we started with Chrome extensions because they were an easier problem to solve they have very few external dependencies but I've also seen Aron app make a forum app too complete with Provisions for a mySQL database now I didn't build this to build a business around it I'm from India and over the last few years I've learned a lot about what markets and ideas you can actually tackle seriously tackle from here solving software engineering is an extremely competitive battle that even open AI will fight in the future and you need between 100 Milli to a few billion dollars to even compete and I don't think we have a shot at winning that it's not just a capital issue it is also a skill issue and spending that much money it's not even a guarantee of winning it's just the price to play so we still built the product because I wanted to learn a lot about AI last year and the only way I know how to learn is by building things so we built the product to learn and test the capabilities of AI agents before us an open source repository called small had appeared on GitHub that inspired us to build out auto code in fact we still use a bit of their logic in the code base Devon seems to use the exact same strategy that small and autocode use here it is number one when you are given a problem you first make a plan of how you're going to solve it then one by one you double click into each of those line items and then set up a plan for how you will solve that all of this is called the dev Loop and while it made it very easy for autoc code or small or even another repository called GPT engineer to solve simple problems it still failed at complicated problems because the dev Loop constantly gets tracked the hardest challenge is to keep the agentic loop on track it tends to derail and start doing other stuff or get stuck in pockets of nonsense the main problem is they get sidetracked into doing tasks they think are important but are either unsolvable or are uncompletable by a machine for example if something in the planning phase is unsolvable for example use XYZ API to pull this data but that API doesn't exist or is unreachable it will forever be stuck there and un stucking it is a pretty manual task all the way back when Auto GPT was a thing it used to get stuck in these things we used to call pockets and we started calling this phenomenon pocketing where the agent gets stuck doing something stupid and doesn't know how to come out of it for example in some stages suppose you tell the agent well go find all the news for today and suppose it decides to find the news from BBC and it requires a login I'm just giving you a hypothetical example maybe it requires a login then it just gets stuck there it doesn't know what to do next and even though it asks you for the with the username and password there are a lot of issues that prevent an agent like this from signing in through a browser to some other website and it kind of gets stuck there so you have to help it out the real measure of all these tools including Devon is to see how they perform end to endend without manual Intervention when they hit a pocket Devon seems to solve 13.86% of tasks which is much better than previous agents but it's still nowhere close to solving software engineering okay so here are my thoughts and here how I see the space evolving I just want to add one caveat that even though I've been right many instances over the last one year and I only credit the fact that we've built stuff whether rapper or not doesn't matter we've built stuff we've learned some of this but I can still be wrong I went on a podcast many moons ago even before we had built the thumbnail tool Alpha CTR and I said that AI might replace creative jobs and a lot of people in the comments they massacred me right they called me all sorts of names but as we've learned many moons later it has become true so remember these are experiences building a tool like this with similar strategy these are meant to be Tak as light post not as gospel and hopefully with this I'm able to tell you what problems existed with this technology then and now so in the past a lot of this pocketing process took place it would get stuck too often like Auto GPT if you remember Auto GPT and it could get stuck on the silliest of things and like I said it's sort of a loop so in the planning phase you come up with fortifi tasks and when you go through each task more planning needs to be done this can also sort of become like an infinite Loop if it doesn't know when the task set is is completed if it doesn't know that hey we've accomplished the goals we set out to accomplish for this task item again this is like a pocket that needs to be solved so what I believe is that the number of pockets that you need to solve were a lot a year ago you needed to help it everywhere and with advances in planning in decision- making and knowing when to stop the loop or when the subtask is done the amount of unpe and help these tools need is lower so your job evolves to helping this junior software engineer in your team that's a bot with areas it is stuck in right now it's going to get stuck very often so it needs your help but over time maybe it will need less and less of your help the second important thing is the prompt itself now if you are building something very standard and studied like a food delivery app GPT or claw itself will give you a decent plan it can write the exact product plan for you the exact feature set for you but many of these cases in the real world and we've learned this are nuanced which means that what is required might be specific to certain countries certain rules certain regulations certain user behaviors I'll give you a very interesting example from India a swiggy product manager once told me that every few seconds their app would go in the background and then come back and it was happening a lot and for a while they didn't know what was going on and at some point they realized that the swiy app when it was going into the background the other food delivery app which is zomato was being brought to the foreground what people were doing was comparing prices that's a behavior that looks like it's more specific to low-income countries like India so what will really be expected of the the product spec that you give the tool is your understanding of the market and the users so being able to clearly tell and AI what you want what people call Prompt engineering but what I just tend to call high quality writing is very important as you know writing is the reflection of your thinking and what you understand so quality thinking and understanding your user becomes very important now you can argue that vun this is more a product manager role than a developer role but like I said these are all artificial constraints we've created okay this person this role does these task this PR does these tasks but actually in the real world that doesn't exist people can do multiple things and more is going to be expected as these tools come out the more clear and concise you can write the closer your generated app is to what you want this might be you writing One spec sheet of exactly what you want some mock-ups of screens and wrestling with the outputs of the AI to figure out which of the things that has generated is closest to what you want so far we have said that the role involves uncke which is UN stucking the bot and clear writing the last piece is about deployment and scaling decisions so let's just assume for this conversation that you can't optimize further than what Deon has written but you can make decisions on where and how you're going to put this up and how you are going to handle scale finally it's about users there's no point building an app if users don't come and if you heard me screaming over the last few years Building Products is getting easier and easier gaining distribution is much harder today this is not only because of AI but because of abstractions about 11 or 12 years ago when I started building my first software company called job spy my first serious one it was a challenge to even do simple things like authentication with OTP today there are like 50 service providers and open source repositories that offer this even payment gateways back then you had to work with the bank payment Gateway API directly you had to work with it raw we didn't have tools like raise the pay or stripe with more people building smaller components you can use you save a lot of time that allows you to build faster but it's also allowing everyone else to build faster which means that the challenge then quickly evolves from can I build the thing and can I build it quickly to can I gain users and find interesting problems to solve with technology now so far the first three job tasks that I've described are exactly what senior Engineers or even your CTO or CPO would do un stucking Juniors unpe Juniors planning exactly what needs to be built writing a spec sheeet for it and making scaling decisions so if you're a senior engineer you just got access to a massive team at a really low cost and Devon allows every single software engineer to play one level up you can play at a higher level of abstraction because you have a junior engineer to do the menial work for you but your work is still to solve problems a lot of Engineers today are saying I'm an expert at this particular technology in this particular framework in this particular stack in this particular language it's like you're being extremely specific about something that is actually fairly broad the truth with young software Engineers is changing how they think is actually very hard I've hired over a thousand people in my life and over 5 00 of them have been software Engineers remember we ran a software consultancy many years ago and to be honest AOS Labs today hires a lot of software Engineers the problem is that in 2021 when startups were raising massive funding rounds Engineers were paid crazy amounts of money and there was a lot of competition these same Engineers were busy shopping offers and bragging on YouTube about how much money they made they were also getting extremely specific about what you need to learn in the software engineering space and I think that kind of hypers specialization might not be good the problem is that there was a sudden drop from there even without AI because of the funding crunch a world with much less funding and jobs and egos were a little hurt when I said a year ago that coding might come under threat with AI the amount of damage I took from especially Junior Engineers was insane it was pretty intense and I wasn't actually used to that much hate we made a real many moons ago about how GPD was able to take some screenshot of something and generate the code for it is a very simple problem and a lot of people said oh you're taking a very simple problem and you're saying oh now it's going to generate the entire front end for you but that's not what we were saying what we were saying is there's a trend line and we are slowly starting to be able to do things with technology that we were not able to do in the past in the exact same way taking a screenshot using computer vision and then regenerating that with code is very different from saying oh if you used a framework this would be one line of code so the comment section was so Furious that we actually just stopped talking about this completely I'll give you an example that doesn't involve AI but something that happened in the previous company of mine there was a front-end engineer at my company who just didn't want to use Tailwind or any CSS framework he was what is known as a purist who was like I want to build this thing from scratch otherwise no point in doing my job it's just someone else's work that we're using I explained to him that we don't want to repeat things from scratch otherwise you should start writing assembly code but the problem with purist is it starts becoming their identity and that's a challenging thing to come out of and that's why every week you have a new front-end framework show up at this point it's commercially useless but it's engineer signaling it's a software engineer showing another software engineer saying look I'm so good at this now I understand some of these problems because I was kind of like that and over the years I've just become much more concerned about solving problems than what my identity is I don't know today if I'm a content creator or an engineer or an entrepreneur or manager I just don't even know I don't even care about what tool I use anymore I'm just like this is the problem we solved how can I solve it in the cheapest and most effective way possible if it's an external tool that's fine the decision-making process of signaling and feeling good and validation from your peers is a sin of every industry as an industry you should be focused on your audience your customer and the minute you forget this and start signaling to peers that oh look how awesome I am you actually start getting into problems because if you truly loved solving problems you would Embrace new tools and new methods of doing things in fact most good Engineers can break things apart and build them up it's not just limited to being good at react and one misconception is that at least in India lots of jobs are like pure software jobs or pure software problems to be solved this is false in B2B one of my learnings and I was wrong about this so I'm going to be honest with you most of the companies are either doing exports yes even the best product B2B companies are selling software abroad not in India you can build software from India you can't sell it to India or there are services companies negligible amount of pure product software companies selling from India to India are doing well in fact if you find more than four or five pure B2B software companies in India selling to India and doing well please tell me because those are the true unicorns the definition of the word unicorn by the way is that these are mythical creatures that are not easily seen on the other hand our consumer successes in India for example zomato or Urban clap are actually solving real world problems with technology or you need some Mo like zeroa where they have a license abishek bakshi an investigative journalist who I think was pretty awesome dug out a very interesting stat that there are less than 60 companies that make significant money from selling anything digitally on apps there are less than 60 apps on the Play Store making more than a million dollars in AR in selling something purely digitally so it's clear that in India at least with mobile apps we are actually using software to solve real world problems than purely digital problems an engineer the word engineer is not just limited to typing code in a particular framework or language look up the definition of engineering the solution to the problem then and even now is to think one level up is to actually become an engineer and solve problems sidan from my team keeps saying this he keeps saying that code may die this decade but engineering will live on forever I'm going to end this with a tweet from Elon a day ago I do truly believe in this too in the last few years I've changed my life to be far more truth seeking as I actually say AGI around the conard I truly believe in this and if this is true it is better to lead a life not attached to careers and specific job roles and be extremely adaptable as time goes on it's better to lead Life as a series of projects and even if some aren't commercially successful who cares I built so many tools and projects last year not as companies or jobs I just had fun doing it I just wanted to learn about it and it looks strange to everybody that you're spending money building these things just to learn about stuff but why not in a world where Ai and fusion technology just take over all economic output the price of everything is going to drop to near zero so you may not actually need money to live if the government figures out real estate in the roof over your head I am okay living on very little money if I need to in fact I'm one of the most frugal people you will ever meet and I always count my blessings that I got to at least work on some of these interesting things while other people don't even get that opportunity you you should go check out how much money the average Indian household actually lives on being attached to your job will give you nothing but suffering over the next few years if AI continues on this unchecked run be flexible and remember we are all in the same boat it's not like me saying that you will lose your job but I will be fine AI will outclass me as much as it outclasses you so we are all in the same boat lots of people say oh pause it stop it or it'll take 10 years or whatever but this is all inevitable if not 2 years it'll take 5 years if not five it'll take 10 at some point in human history complete automation was bound to happen if for a second you disconnect your life from the job and you realize the point of life is to experience everything and I don't know what the point of life is right but let's say my point of life is to experience as much as possible and seek the truth and not sit 9 to5 somewhere you will see AI as Liberation not as the enemy and until that point there will be some turbulence as this mental adjustment to a world without jobs happens until that time comes we will fight it we won't go gently into that Utopia that's it for me and remember you should chart your own path nobody on the internet can tell you what to do they can just give you their learnings and their thoughts bye"}

experiment into a very big business I view our responsibility as not just Building Services that people like but Building Services that are good for people and good for Society Facebook has squashed potential threats you've got families whose children are either severely harmed or gone there another major setback for Facebook still no word from Mark Zuckerberg in the Facebook Cambridge analytica Scandal let me ask you this there's families of victims here today have you apologized to the victims would you to do so now Mr Zuckerberg why should your company not be sued for [Music] this for a long time the prevailing narrative about Zuckerberg was that he's a robot and doesn't have emotions and steals your data this past year especially has been quite eventful for Mark Zuckerberg he created Facebook as you all know which is is now known as meta a huge company in social media but a year ago even the people who invested in his company were upset with him they thought he was ruining the main part of his social media business by spending too much money on creating the metaverse a digital world that at that time seemed like a fantasy to many when meta announced it wasn't making as much money as expected in last year's earnings report its stock value dropped significantly and people were very disappointed in Zuckerberg that's when the narrative for Zuckerberg had reached its lowest however things had turned around in the past year meta which connects 3.1 billion people daily through Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp and makes money by selling ads is now doing much much better on October 25th the company said it had made $ 34.1 billion in just 3 months which is 23% more than the same time period last year this increase is the biggest for meta since the online surge during the covid-19 Pand pmic its profits more than doubled to 11.6 billion since the low point last year meta's stock value has gone up 250% but here's an interesting Insight which we've recently figured out a reason that increased expenditure and lower profits in the time period where their stock had hit a new low in a conversation between Nat Friedman and Daniel gross one thing stood out what was said is that one thing that's underrated is that the Nader that happened which is the low point that happened with their stock price people forget the driver of it was not meta reality lab people already knew the cost of that it was their capex expenditures which was their onetime expenses in infrastructure which were going up massively so I wrote at the time this is actually they need to be investing in capex this AI stuff is super important the profitability was actually inflated for a few quarters because they were selling chips they had already written off but meta bought up all these chip orders so they got into all the gpus which are the graphic processing units the units required for AI processing before everyone else did and they revealed last quarter they had this astronomical Fleet of gpus because of that specific quarter the quarter they got killed in the stock market was actually one of the single most important Investments they had made for the next 5 years and they ended that conversation with saying don't bet against Zak but right after Zak resurrected the business with all the open source AI stuff that they come out with the media started again by talking about how immoral a person he is by bringing up something he did 20 years ago in fact and I quote if you had to capture silicon Valley's dominant ideology in a single anecdote you might First Look to Mark Zuckerberg sitting in the blue glow of his computer some 20 years ago chatting with a friend about how his new website the Facebook had given him access to Realms of personal information about his fellow students they then brought up a chat which we've seen many times before from many different media organizations and they use this again and again to show how Zak is such a villain Zuckerberg yeah yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard just ask I have over 4,000 emails pictures addresses SNS the friend says what how do you manage that one and zaker BG says people just submitted it I don't know why they trust me dumb Facebook now meta has become an avatar of all that is wrong with Silicon Valley its self-interested role in spreading Global disinformation is an ongoing crisis in Facebook's early days Zuckerberg listed revolutions among his interests this was around the time that he had a business card Ed with I'm CEO the interesting thing is that very few of these writers have actually run a social media Network I can tell you that on any content moderation decision that you take you have one side of your platform that will agree and the other side that will disagree take misinformation with the Israel Palestine War as an example when one side puts up a photo nobody knows if the photo is real or AI generated only the person who put it up does sometimes even the person who puts up that image does not know if it's real or AI generated now if Facebook takes it down this side will complain and say it is censoring information if they keep it up on the other hand the other side will say hey this is misinformation how can you allow the platform to have misinformation what I've learned over many many years of just watching the Twitter battle play out is that what people actually mean when they say don't show misinformation is show me my side don't show any other side and with social media that is the real battle absolutely nobody can agree on what is the truth and what is lies not even extremely smart people but let's go back to the character flaw argument that Mark Zuckerberg is some crazy megalomaniac and he really wants to take over the world and stuff like that you know I meet so many 19 20y old Founders by virtue of what I do and most if not all if they end up getting early success like Zak when he was 19 they are extremely arrogant in fact when you're 1920 you have to be a little arrogant going after building a business like Facebook because it's an extremely hard problem to even win in the first place early success also comes with arrog and thinking you are Beyond other people like I said it's almost inevitable for most who become successful early and that card saying I'm CEO most of you reading this who are very young would have thought oh that's such a cool thing to have because the first time you become CEO and you raise money you feel really cool you feel like you've made it right the word for that is immaturity because let's face it most people who think like that are actually pretty immature but the entire point of immaturity is that one day you do become mature and I think Mark SS had so many battles since that day 20 years ago and today that's kind of unfair to go back to something he did 20 years ago and say look look he was a bad guy then hey so I'm going to interrupt you from the video for about a minute now about a year ago I was occasionally involved with a YouTube channel that I think is a laugh Riot that has slowly evolved into a pretty Kick-Ass infotainment Channel full disclosure it's run by my wife and they are now known in the industry for really high quality editing not only did they start this channel they also started a video Mastery co-host where they taught video editing and the science of how to make a perfect video for YouTube over a 3-month cohort but what's different between avv and any other course is they're very focused on placements and outcomes in fact they've trained over 1,700 video editors so far and 80% of the students that sat for placements actually ended up getting a job the average placement am was over 4 lakhs and ANM and many top Employers in India consistently higher from them including individuals like nikil Kut Raj sh tan B Varun duala and many others and at the same time businesses like unacademy physics Wala zeroda Zoho and so much more this was an underrated non-mainstream role that is suddenly starting to become mainstream and over the last one year we've also seen the salary range for this continuously increase because as you know where there's an audience that's continuously scrolling content there is also supposed to be a supply and avv is creating that Supply so if you're looking for a new job a career switch or you're just looking to learn video editing for fun and be part of this ecosystem or become a Creator this is the right path for you they're doing a free webinar to tell you a little bit about the cohort and also show you a few tricks on making a high quality video so even if you don't buy anything definitely join the webinar because you get to learn a thing or two and even if you're outside of India you can join this webinar you can learn from it and you can also join the cohort and be eligible to jobs geographies are no longer barriers now back to the video from what most people can see the trials and tribulations of being in the media light and having your every move scrutinized has actually made him a much better person now I'm not at all defending any of the things he did when he was young it's wrong to talk about your users like that I am very sure you can take almost every person who looks at something that Zuckerberg did 20 years ago and points at it as oh I'm better than this person go through their lives and I'm very sure you'd find at least one or two instances where you could look at that from the light of oh this person has done a bad thing but that's the point even if you did something when you were 18 or 19 or 20 and you've been through 10 or 20 or 30 years and you've learned from it then all is good the entire point of humanity is redemption and now it is pretty obvious that people are using him as a scapegoat if you watched his testimonial in the Senate when he was asked to apologize to everyone it was clear this was just politicians looking to drag someone in the mud for popularity because one of the arguments was that children are becoming addicted and are doing bad things on your platform if you go with that argument then you definitely also have to ban gun makers or cigarette makers first newspapers too a lot of tele ision today shows sexual activity and people killing each other and whatnot and if you really stretch the argument then you have to ban the US government if any citizen of the United States commits a crime and unlike governments Facebook is actually free to use governments charge you money to be on the streets and the problem isn't one of actually moderating the content the problem is of agreeing what is acceptable content and what is not because people are so divided on every single thing today on social media forget about Facebook even judges in the US can't agree on what is right and wrong but over many years years I've come to see this in very different light I feel like this is an arena because before the era of social media where people just watch their TVs or read the news any individual who wanted to say something had to go through mainstream media You' actually have to call up the TV and say something or something you said would be in the newspaper snippet so today actually for the first time all of us are spectators but we're also Spectators with the voice and the rules of this Arena actually follow the rules of a very interesting little TV show that TV show is called World Wrestling Entertainment that's right the WWE ever since social media and the fact that anyone can put up a video the world as I see it social media as I see it has become the WWE in professional wrestling there are two terms that are used to denote types of characters the first term is the term heal and the other one is called face they used to describe two distinct types of characters or personas that wrestlers embody to play out stories and rivalries in the ring a heal is essentially the villain or the bad guy in wrestling story lines they engage in underhanded tactics break the rules and often behave in a way that is designed to make the audience dislike them the heels role is to create conflict and make the audience root for their opponent on the other hand there's something called the face which is short for baby face this term refers to the hero or good guy in wrestling story lines faces are the wrestlers whom the fans are meant to support and cheer for they fight fairly respect the rules and show sportsmanship faces often overcome various obstacles including the villainous schemes of heals to Triumph or seek Justice within the storyline in fact the most important thing for a baby face to have is the ability to be relatable to the audience while all the heels are completely unrelatable to the audience this dynamic between heels and faces is Central to professional wrestling storytelling what it does is it creates a clear narrative for the audience to get invested in this is the bad guy this is the good guy the reason I mentioned clear narrative is because in real life nobody is truly black or white we're all Shades of Gray we all have flaws and we all have good parts but audiences want clear narratives from the media is this guy good please tell me if he's good is this guy bad tell me I don't want to make my decisions on whether the person is good or bad you tell me and sometimes the details don't really matter all of us when the Cambridge analytica thing happened we all went oh scam privacy data leakage Thief scammer and the media portra like that but do you know what actually happened based on what the media said they knew it was a scandal and that Facebook was a bad company and Mark Zuckerberg was a bad person but I will tell you what happened exactly what happened in the 2010s personal data belonging to millions of Facebook users was collected by British consulting firm Cambridge analytica predominantly to be used for political advertising you know what Cambridge analytica had done was that they made an app which is sort of like a quiz where they were testing you on your psychological profile and based on that that they were selling that data not Facebook but Cambridge analytica was selling that data to government officials now a lot of people when they found out went to Facebook and said this is a data breach but Facebook officials arguing that those who took the personality quiz originally consented to give away their information it was a third- party app it was not a Facebook app and anyone with even five brain cells knows that in that era Facebook allowed absolutely anyone to make third party apps when Cambridge analytica signed up with Facebook they said that hey we're going to use this data for research and then lied to Facebook about it and then ran political ads to that audience if some random app on the IOS app store takes your data and runs away with it it's like blaming apple and calling it an apple Scandal even though apple has a review system it is very easy to get past the review system and steal users data if the users voluntarily give you that data for a long time no matter what Mark Zuckerberg did people with still call him a thief fraud even the media really jumped on it they had made him the heel of the real world even during that Apple Facebook battle with advertising where Apple banned Facebook's targeted ads followed by launching their own ad platform people still blamed Zuckerberg and praised Apple but here's the thing life really mimics fiction see in WWE wrestlers may switch between being a heel and a face through their careers based on storylines and audience reactions a process known as a heel turn or a face turn and as you all know for a long time Mark Zuckerberg has been the heel then he realized something the golden rule of the WWE if you want to turn from heal to face which is if you want to turn from a bad guy to a good guy all you need to do is to be relatable people didn't like or dislike him because of his business decisions he just seemed like an unrelatable guy somebody that you really don't see yourself as because see a lot of people they want to see themselves in who they're rooting for and very few people could see themselves inside Zuck because I definitely don't want to be that person and everything about that person disgusts me that was the main problem and he realized that changing his PR narrative to face would be valuable to the business too so he made the face turn he became relatable he went to Jiu-Jitsu he started raising cattle at a ranch somewhere he started putting out content directly to the public when the Apple Vision Pro came out he decided to make a video on it and the public perception of that video was that here was a CEO with billions of dollars sitting in front of a camera telling the world why his product was better than the competitor's product with artificial intelligence instead of taking the closed route that openi and a bunch of other companies took he decided to make everything open source llama 2 is open source and it's not just Lama to their research arm has released so many different open source AI tools that the developer Community now really likes and respects Zuckerberg more than anything he realizes that there's going to be a straightup battle between meta and Apple at some point and he lost the last battle despite the fact that he had the platform on mobile Apple had the bigger platform which is IOS and Facebook had to play by all of ios's rules which is why he moved into hardware and said with the next platform which is headsets I don't want to play by Apple's rules anymore and he was okay with flipping a finger to all of his investors telling them hey I am going to bet on the long term because if we own the hardware we can be the next apple if Apple wins the hardware and we continue to build software we will always be smaller but mainly till now his story was told by the media remember most news travels on Instagram Facebook and WhatsApp all three of which he controls if he was a dictator why would he allow them to come on his platform and talk about him but he still let that happen but then he realized what a lot of other Founders have realized you can just skip the media and go direct so Zuckerberg decided to go direct he became an influencer by becoming relatable and putting more of his life in front of other people in front of the audiences like us the videos he's been putting up the live stream he does now we can see all of this on our feet and whenever an opportunity or meme came by like the cage fight with Elon Zak jumped on the opportunity and that started the resurrection of Mark Zuckerberg because see from my perspective the truth is that Zak has always been a business and social media genius the Twitter account mostly borrowed ideas has a great thread on his achievements so far and why many people are still long on Zak at the age of 19 Zak founded Facebook in 2004 between 2004 and 2007 here are the list of companies that made an attempt to buy Facebook friends Google three times The Washington Post Viacom three times Myspace news cop NBC AOL Microsoft Yahoo twice in fact Yahoo was the first to offer a billion dollars which is 50 times sales for Facebook in 2006 Zak's response this is kind of a formality just a quick board meeting it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes we're obviously not going to sell here why he said that Yahoo had no definite idea about the future they did not properly value things that did not exist they were there therefore undervaluing the business Zak would have received $250 Million by selling Facebook at that point think about the belief one needs to say no to that for a 22-year-old was it purely Financial is it because Yahoo's ticket wasn't big enough what Zak said was that I would only use the money to start another social network and I like the one I have think about all the social media sites that failed before Facebook and you have slightly less than $1 billion on the table and most of your colleagues are threatening to leave yes at that point a lot of people Facebook were threatening to leave who would say no to that Zuck did and he ended it with one line right which is it's about mission one year before Facebook's IPO Google launched Google Plus and it was like a David versus golad Battle Google's profit was many times Facebook's Revenue one month before Facebook's IPO Zak bought Instagram and this was seen by everyone in the market as a really bad move according to the thread Zak called the Instagram guys over negotiated the deal in 48 hours and acquired them for a billion dollars on April 09 2012 seoa who had invested money recently doubled their money in 5 days Facebook 100x their money in 6 years you might think that acquiring Instagram was a no-brainer and it was the obvious decision considering it was going to be so big but many others in the social media space passed on it Jack dosy for example made a pass he didn't want to buy it in March 2012 Instagram had 13 employees and zero Revenue when Facebook bought them you can look in the past and say Instagram is so big but that time to make that decision required courage and especially when Facebook's about to IPO when the entire public is watching he did not care he made that decision anyway in fact there were a lot of questions after their IPO whether they'll even survive in a mobile world in 2012 their mobile Revenue was Zero but by 2019 on the back of Instagram $60 billion Facebook in fact now owns four of the five most used social apps Facebook Instagram WhatsApp and messenger yes messenger is considered a separate app the best part Zuck is still really young he's still in his 30s Zak is one of the few founder CEOs to still be around everyone else has handed the CEO role to somebody else by playing the Android narrative with the quest and the open source narrative with AI he's playing out this Robin Hood character and it's working out for him and all that nonsense investors gave him about the meta wore for the stock crashing those same investors are hailing Apple like some genius company for doing the same thing at many more times the price so all I have to say for everyone watching is there are a lot of lessons from Zak's face turn and the entire world is tuned in in fact the era of the founder influencer is just beginning and for Mark Zuckerberg he's playing one of the most important story when it comes to the Land of Stories he's playing the comeback story I want to leave you with a real I saw on Instagram and this real brings out emotions in almost everyone who watches it because now that he's relatable many people now see a small piece of themselves inside Mark Zuckerberg if there's Redemption for him there's Redemption for me that's it for me I'm going to leave you with the real bye you know what the greatest story is it's the comeback story imagine yourself a wounded soul with a broken confidence in having lost it all but then you pick yourself up you Rise From the Ashes and the pits of anxiety and depression you heal both physically mentally and emotionally you get fitter leaner faster and more mentally resilient Against All Odds you Vanquish your inner demons so you must remember the comeback is always stronger than the setback"}

it or hate it most people think the design is amazing but what people don't know is that the hardware design and Engineering for the R1 was created by a company called teenage engineering and if you dig into the company you'll find some golden insights about hardware and design even the nothing one earphones this is the company behind it ladies and gentlemen today we're going to talk about teenage engineering see everyone wants to build the next apple a hardware company that makes beautiful physical stuff but people think that the next apple will look like apple see when the first view Apple Max got popular they look like this but at that time IBM computers looked like this so Apple was the different design most people didn't really like it because most people using computers were professionals people didn't fully like it because it was different from the standard so when we ask ourselves what's the next apple we have to look look at design that looks very different to the norm right now ladies and gentlemen here are the Teenage engineering [Music] products I couldn't get my hands on any of this because most of their current products are out of stock but the story of the company and their insights are very interesting teenage engineering is a Swedish company founded in 2005 by jper Jens and David the three of whom had previously led the computer games company Net Baby World from 1999 to 2003 their first product the op1 was introduced at the Nam show in 2010 shortly after the release teenage engineering started doing something weird for a hardware company they started producing several accessories the company follows a very strict design AOS they collaborated for example with the Swedish company cheap Munday to make work cloths and field apparel for them this company breeds design in all forms they don't actually seem to care whether it's Hardware or software or clothes this is in stark contrast to some uiux designers who make the same five purple websites for the same kind of companies design is a skill that is supposed to surpass platforms there's a reason that even the videos Apple produces are kickass but if you ask a generic uiux designer to make a video they'll say oh I'm not a video guy I don't know anything about this but there are some more insights about design from teenage engineering towards the end of this video let's get back in 2018 teenage engineering announced a new line of audio equipment products frequence in collaboration with Ikea eventually these sort of Niche consumer electronics companies start doing business to business so they started doing B2B building cool products for businesses on 22nd May 2019 a company called Panic announced play date which is a new handheld video game console designed in collaboration with teenage engineering the device featured a mechanical crank it's like a crank which is a signature teenage engineering Edition at $199 which is about 16,000 rupees the play date is actually the cheapest way to experience teenage engineering's work on February 25th 2021 teenage engineering announced that it will partner with the british-based tech company nothing to produce the design aesthetic of their products teenage engineering later worked on the device the Year One which was nothing's first product now what's the value of such beautiful design it makes the product more expensive but as apple and teenage engineering have found out beautiful Next Level design brings you die hard fans that's the value of beautiful Hardware Die Hard fans look at this guy who tattooed a teenage engineering product on his hand if you go through their Reddit if you go through there ask me any I'm telling you the fan base is extremely loyal to them because differentiated design brings loyalty teenage engineering has now become a brand where the minute a company says we're partnering with teenage engineering people don't mind paying the extra premium for beautiful stuff people now have disposable income they have little extra cash they can spend and they don't mind spending a little more for beauty in their lives and houses more importantly take a look at this packaging they have some Japanese in there because really good design has to borrow and spin off from multiple places and multiple cultures the market that teenage engineering is really tapping is people who are deciding that they need dedicated devices for some stuff like Teenage engineering put out the tp7 which is a digital tape recorder see I record a lot I use recording as a replacement to writing sometimes and teenage engineering built this product that just feels like it'll feel good at a price the grand price of 1 lakh more than one lakh for a tape recorder add on top of that the field bag a small bag for 4,000 rupe with AI getting better A lot of the errors that you're going to need to press backspace for are gone so a key feature of the tp7 is AI based transcription which automatically converts what you've said using audio to text like whisper to transcribe and chat gbt to summarize and rewrite but the lesson to learn from this is how the hell are they marketing a tape recorder bloody tape recorder at OnePlus lacks and this is a master class it's all about touch and feel read this from their website off the Record picture yourself in an interview situation the real on the team pp7 is spinning slowly the bright red record lamp is lit both the Reel and the lamp indicates that a recording is taking place the interview is going quite well the situation gets heated you suddenly asked some personal questions in that moment you gently place a finger on the Reel and pause the recording allowing you to continue the interview off the Record it's like a n time story that you tell your kids set with the Vibes and moods see that's the thing beautiful design high quality writing and high quality video they tap human emotions when you see the rabbit R1 it reminds you of a Pokédex it reminds many Nerds like me of our past when you see these products you feel some emotion because one it's not an ordinary looking product it's not average and two because they are marketed beautifully and modeled around Nostalgia feelings of the past the reason you don't feel that today towards any phone is because you've seen too many phones they all look the same you've seen too many cars they all look the same they're normal they're boring and that's the takeaway for today everybody wants to be a designer designing the same type of website but design is far more it's about opening up human emotions when you see a video it's about can you package the video better so people are more connected to you it's not about copying the same current style website again and again here's a quote from the founder of teenage engineering who actually went out and said that the designers and the design we're producing as a function of fast growth Venture Capital this push to IPOs it's not healthy I'm going to read out the quote for you we only want to make great products and when you don't Focus only on making money and have reached a certain level everything becomes about quality right now there's a certain cultural fascination with fast growth IPOs and so on but I want to go slow really slow and think longterm it takes time to do good things you see this cultural phenomenon of speed and growth at all costs is displayed in every startup they all look the same it's like fast food it looks good its taste is consistent but then you feel horrible afterwards that's the reason I'm not raising venture capital for my new company I want to take my time I want to do it slowly and like a dish that's being simmered for the flavor I don't mind the company taking forever to get the flavor of who I am inside of it one more insight while doing research for this video I looked up and ask me anything that they did on Reddit they were asked how they come up with these designs this is what they said we tried to to create things that's not out there when we decide to create something new everyone really needs to believe in it and to make it great and the best way to do so is to do as unique things as possible to keep the inspiration going we always work until the deadline and try to add as much fun stuff as possible it's hard to stop when you have fun at work so it's a reflection of the fun they have and the fact that they're trying to be unique at all times they don't fit into a mold the Stark opposite side of this is all the young kids who have gone to the same types of engineering colleges for four years are all going for the same front-end engineering roles and have no unique differentiation this is the alternate parallel teenage engineering has incredible gross margins the gross margins of the future are going to be built on the emotions of people with disposable income so you're going after a very specific profile of person who will buy from you and teenage engineering is a master class in making that happen because mostly the utility of what they build is commoditized the term commoditize refers to the process by which products or Services become indistinguishable from each other in the same category like Engineers all going for the front- end role leading to competition primarily on price which is all their salaries come down rather than on features or quality this typically happens when the market is flooded with similar products or Services making it difficult for consumers to discern a significant difference between them a tape recorder is cheap even if people on Twitter point out that they're a status and luxury item manufacturer people will still buy the more average your product looks the less your gross margin so you're functioning making no profit no margin you're not able to research and development your product doesn't look good and as much as people come out and say I want to build really affordable companies I want to give these things for free over time you realize that when your gross margin is low you can't actually do research and development you can't actually build great products so you're stuck competing with price with everybody else and we've seen some of these stories take place in India Micromax carbon lava at some point Micromax is making billions of dollars in India now they are sub hundred million in Revenue right so the minute you build a generic product and say I'm going to be extremely affordable it's a very Noble thought and a very Noble philosophy until you die 5 years later whereas like apple and teenage engineering when you have margins but also build really high quality product take the time take the process to do it well then you end up with better gross margins to make more beautiful products and actually build a good company while at it I want to end with a quote from the CEO in an interview and I took away a lot from this particular quote I really like to learn new things the learning process fascinates me I want to understand how the world works so I go from area to area and then I try to make connections what I have learned is that many things are basically the same in different disciplines so if you work with fashion or design of film making or even banking you know it's basically the same principles that have a different shape but if you've moved from one to another then you start to see a pattern everything I do is some kind of experiment and I've been surprised many times that if you have the will to try things chances are that it works thank you and make sure you subscribe bye"}

{"video_id": "6BjaFjR6LBY", "title": "24 Hours With The Apple Vision Pro In India", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BjaFjR6LBY", "transcript": "I'm watching a video of a horse while on a horse. This is really strange. Okay, stop. Vision Pro is a new kind of computer that augments reality by seamlessly blending the real world with the digital world. It's the first Apple product you look through and not out. Vision Pro feels familiar yet it’s entirely new You can see here and interact with digital content in your physical space and you control Vision Pro using the most natural and intuitive tools your eyes, hands and voice with Vision Pro You're no longer limited by a display. Your surroundings become an infinite canvas. Ladies and gentlemen, we're wearing the Apple Vision Pro. I've used the HTC Vive. I've used the Quest 2 I've used the Quest 3, and now I'm wearing this device. Let's find out if it's actually useful. This isn't going to be like a technical review, I'm not going to go through all the details. I'm just going to wear it like a normal human being outside and see if I can live my life through this. The 24 hours is a little bit of a clickbait and let's see if we're able to gain some thoughts and some insights out of this. And I'll also see if I can compare it to previous headsets that I've owned. Follow me. First thoughts, I've seen a lot of people wear this outside and like run around and stuff. It's not actually that good looking. The pass through you can still see its video. You can still tell its a video. And when you move your head really fast the pass through jitters. So it's not you know, like seeing the real world. It's not like waiting a block on glass and then looking into the world. And even though it's much better than the Quest 3, it's still not that good. It's still not as good as many of the videos make it seem. Let’s do the Dino Experience. While the pass through isn't great, I definitely think the quality of VR on this all the 3D is really good. Like all the rendering, you can tell it's like sharp. Okay so we're doing the Encounter Dinosaurs Experience, there’s small little butterfly. Okay, this looks really good. This looks really, really, really good. Yeah, the pass through sucks, but this is amazing. Oh, my God, this is really cool. That was sick. Let’s try Jigs Space. This is a Jig. Walk around, lean in to see the details, to continue, pinch and hold with your right middle finger. Oh Jigs can do so much more. Uh Let's see F1 The Alfa Romeo C43 Uh So this is really good AR because it's like sort of stuck in place. So sitting nicely on the floor, which means tracking is great. The old way of doing tracking, especially on video, is that there are plenty of points in space. You identify the points usually they’re points with high contrast and you check how they move. As I move the headset Do the points get smaller, Do they get bigger? And based on that you can triangulate how this thing is moving. This though looks pretty fantastic. So let's do one thing. Let's take spatial video of this place so we can immortalize it. All right, let's do that. So I click here and I say video and I stop. The interesting thing is people think I can't see them. They're pointing at me and saying things because the old VR headsets, where you couldn't see through it. But I can absolutely see through this. *Fan Interaction* Okay, Stop. Very quickly, see you. Give me one puri dosa A lot of people ask me, Why don't you speak Hindi. You're not being true to India, and all. But I think they're far more languages in India than Hindi I speak Kannada. For example, a lot of people don't know that Give me one puri dosa So the cool part about this is using an app like Chat GPT or GPT Vision. I can look at this and ask it question like, where does this originate from? Or, How many calories does it have? But I know the Meta Ray Ban glasses can do this as well. So, Is a $3,500 device really necessary? I don't know. *Fan Interaction* Sir, shooting is not allowed here. So we were not let in that place because we were wearing the Vision Pro. Which is strange because how small does it need to get before people like, those are just a bunch of glasses, get in. I don't know this is an experiment. It decided to subtitle bodega what each day. It's a nice option. This mixing method that used to be the app will look backed up because I had told you that the app will attach even Wallachia was sun good? Yeah. Medieval. How to make eggs. Let's say, and let's go through YouTube see something interesting to watch. Watching a video on how to make scrambled eggs. This is how to make scrambled eggs. I normally have three out of ten add one tablespoon of You know what. I never follow guides anyway. So let's see if I can make something that is better than what this guy has given us. Sunny side up, Okay. Yeah. Can’t see. Despite the fact that all the Vision Pro videos show the person in perfect clarity running around doing stuff, I actually spilt it a little bit because I don't know, it's just a little bit hard to see. Or maybe I'm going blind. Yeah, maybe that's true maybe I’m going blind. Sometimes the eye tracking is wrong because I sort of click and then my mind moves away. But then I realize it's still tracking my eyes. So one really cool app that I saw, it's actually by an Indian developer  is called Charana. This is like a 3D environment where I can see like a little bit of the mountain around me. It's probably an HDRi. And then I see the video of Kashmir, this video is super high quality. Oh, my God. My eggs. My eggs, My eggs. No, how I get rid of this. Yes, sir. No, the honest truth is, this is all just. I can just have a TV in the room doing this. You know the real question is, what kind of life do you want to live, right. Like, what kind of world do you envision. I don't know if screens are all around me are really the path forward. I like the 3D world idea more, and while AR looks exciting and interesting, I don't want it to be screens. I want it to be things like a pet you can just runs around in the house like that little cutie over there. This is very interesting. It's a very good V 1.0 but there's miles to go. But thank you Apple for showing us the future. I think it's interesting that something like this even exists and this is what I dreamt of when I was young. But I have seen something like this before with the Quest 3, and therefore it's not such a big leap. But the one experience that did blow me away was the entire like the Dinosaur Experience. I thought that was fantastic but it needs more of those. It means killer apps, it needs content. And there’s YouTube stuff that I can watch it on my phone, I can watch it on screens. I don't need to buy this $3,500 device for it. The one thing I did like is spatial video. In fact, let's do that right. With the end of the day, let's review everything we have seen today and let's step into those environments. Let's step into photos. We took some spatial photo and video. Let's see all of them. Look at this. Wow This is pretty cool. This reminds me of today. This could be the killer app for the Vision Pro. You can relive memories as if you were actually there. Wow, this is cool. This is my nice little Dosa from today. It's pretty cool. I can see how we can bring the real world into VR or AR in this case, quite literally, right. Like the edge of this thing is blending into the real world. So there is no difference between the fake world and the real world. Lines are blurred."}

going to get straight to the questions I'll tell you these these all going to come from my own Curiosities as a Founder right I want to learn a lot of things and there is this narrative in India of this is a VC Narrative of build one narrow Focus don't do anything else get really big at that okay and this was the prevailing narrative for about 78 years right uh the last 7 eight years but in the last year or so things have changed because a because people realized India is not such a large Market but you have an interesting Counterpoint to this which is that all these very Niche spaces have kind of been exhausted and you believe in a completely different narrative which is you got to do parallel things you got to do multiple things and you have to keep that experimentation bandwidth open as an early stage company right and you have a name for it it's called The Compound startup so I would love to hear your thoughts on this yeah so basically my my belief is that we've been building software WR for the last two decades um because everyone's been focused on these these sort of very narrow Point solution problems particularly in B2B SAS which is sort of the the area that I I tend to know a lot about um and one one problem with this is that a lot of the problem space has been exhausted um so you know basically any vertical you can imagine there are a couple different SAS companies that are sort of going after that area um but the second thing that that goes wrong with that is there there's actually an opportunity a a lot of the biggest problems that businesses face are problems that sort of span multiple departments multiple functional areas they problems of business process decision making the way the organization operates and to solve them you really need to sort of operate like many of these different systems and get them to like work together in like a seamlessly kind of interoperable way um and and so when you're when you're building multiple products in one there are a lot of product advantages that you have um things are more integrated um with each other but also usually with like underlying business data um in our case like employee data um you can you can go really deep on shared componentry um so ripling I sometimes say that Rip's mission is to decompose business software into its constituent parts and then rebuild software and all these different verticals out of these underlying elements um and what that allows us to to do is to go really deep on Concepts like reports and permissions and workflow automations and approvals and other core Primitives that you see again and again and again across a lot of different business software and build those way better then point solution competitors would be able to afford to build them um so there are all these like product I'm convinced that like the global like Minima the the best products are the ones that are actually sort of allinone um and that's a way not just to sort of win a sales and marketing game but it's a way to build better product experiences for end users would you say the the word for this the the common speak for this is a bundled solution you're building a bundled solution so what I don't like about the world the word bundled is it implies that the that the driving force is the sales and marketing the the packaging um that um you do have a bunch of advantages from a go to market perspective but I think you can also build better products like I think that you know a lot of times compound products are not they're not just um sometimes people mistakenly believe that you're selling good enough versions of these products but you have these sales and marketing advantages because they're you know bundled together um I think there's an opportunity if you if you take the right technical approach um to actually build products that are better um each individual product is better than its Standalone competitors and you also obviously have these sales and marketing advantages from selling them you know all together but where do you start like let's say you were starting Rippling tomorrow in a different space right let's say we're starting in in sales software for example would you start with like a narrow wedge like play the play the story for me from the day you started Rippling to the point where you're like okay now we we do multiple things or was it like day one hey we're going to bet here we're going to bet here and we're going to bet here I can tell you exactly the way I would build um a ripling for sales software um but it there there's a huge upfront investment um I think that you know there are a few what would that number be if you had to put a number on The Upfront investment man I don't know I don't I I I'm not sure I could put a dollar a dollar number to it but I think what you need to do you know the the tricky thing particularly on the sales side is that you need to build the underly platform like a lot of people have made the mistake of trying to go after CRM the application layer so they build this CRM application but the way that you need to win in CRM is you actually need to build the underline sort of platform system so things like custom objects workflows configurable views reports dashboards workflows permissions like all of that stuff and you have to invest really deeply there because that's the you know everyone that sort of tries to go up against Salesforce sort of crashes and burns because they they don't do the hard work of building that stuff they just build the sort of application on top and it's never without that underlying Machinery it's like never configurable enough you can't dial it in enough to kind of get it right the second thing that I think you need to do is one of the weaknesses I think the the the sales space is a great example of an area where because there are so many different applications you need to string together to run your sales organization um and they're not natively built together they're they're connected via apis but these apis are often just very thin straws to pass data between applications and so if you had like natively built software not just for cor CRM but also for call recording and transcription what you know products like gong do for sort of email and sequence management what products like Outreach do for you know scheduling and calendaring products like calendly chili Piper things like that if you had like data orchestration tools that are often like add-ons to Salesforce to manage you know lead databases and contacts and things like that D you know if you had all of those things in one system it would solve an enormous number of problems for businesses that that have struggle with sort of the way Salesforce is dependent on this ecosystem of sort of thinly connected services um now how do you build all that you know all at once how do you how do you build the full platform layer all of these different applications the answer is it's like probably impossible um uh I don't know how you do it I think that like it's one of the things that makes doing startups hard is because like doing a startup and making it successful is somewhere between completely impossible and just very very very hard and between those two extremes there's such a narrow ray of light that passes through um so I don't I don't have the answer on how you do that but I think that like you know the the big advantage of compound software businesses is like in in so many places with software the central question is like well if I build this like does it even matter you know like will anyone care and and with a lot of sort of compound software products the the answer is very clear that if you can find a way to get there it's it's Superior in fundamental Prof ways um it's just like really hard to sort of get there but it's against conventional wec wisdom which is like hey build a calendly competitor and then get really good at that don't don't touch any of the other you know verticals in the area but you're saying that just go raise a bunch of money build the infr layer first build authentication and your views and stuff first and then build these individual components on top think of cly as one thing your product offers versus that's the entire thing yeah because you you you look if if you can build a software suite that solves a fundamental business problem which is like really managing the sort of the customer the prospect Journey you know from become from like lead to like customer and then the customer life cycle um you want to solve the whole problem and to solve that that whole problem you need a whole bunch of different applications um and you need them to sort of be seamlessly interoperable and and when when you try and string together a dozen different point solutions to do that stuff there are always these interstices between the products that you know where they don't quite fit together right and um and you need uh a lot of human intervention to kind of make things work um and that that ends up being you know the central advantage of compound software businesses is that you know those those gaps sort of fade away um when you're building these things natively on one system interesting so I think this is on the the the vision side of the company right this is how you've built tripling but I think all of this is built by talent and you have a very special recipe SL playbook for how you build an Aug and one thing that ripling is famous for every podcast I've ever watched off rling everyone I've ever spoken to is like you hire the most number of exf Founders in the world you put them all together you have a Playbook and I'm hoping I can you know tease out that Playbook over this conversation you take the founder you say here's the idea here's the Playbook and then once that product is mature you drive this this fire hose of demand SL distribution to it and then that product starts working right uh we we do this a very small scale we figure out this one small thing about YouTube like the alpha is uh it's all about edit and packaging people don't believe this but it's actually a lot about just compressing that video from something that could be 20 minutes to 10 minutes right and then everything that you put away uh you it's your judgments depending on what you put away right yeah and if you can repeat this over multiple channels which is what we've started doing now then you have a Playbook and then now you're like okay what's the kind of talent that that could be able to create this so you've done the same thing but you've done it in software you pick up the most number of EX Founders curiously I don't know what the Playbook is yeah I so the The Playbook on the hiring side is I mean we'd love to hire former found um you know people who like have know what that grind is like um and they know sort of like how pre precious it is to find like product Market fit and there's like a hustle and maybe even like a desperation to sort of like trying to get something to work um because you need someone to kind of drive that internally um and we sort of say look you know this is the only place where you can be a founder and you can build a product where it's true that like if you build it they will come um because we really can bring a lot of you know if you build a great product we can bring a fire hose of distribution to it how have you built that distribution is it based on the existing ripling uh user base and the connections and the network that you have it so it's we're really good at Cross sell it's one of the things that's very unique about our goto Market motion um so ripling you know last month did about $8 million in net new Revenue just from Cross cell so we our in our are increased by $8 million just from a cross sale perspective and then we also did a lot of new logo sales as well for the audience can you explain what a cross sell is in your context it means selling new stuff to existing customers so you already have some kind of relationship with a company you know they're buying maybe they're buying payroll from us maybe they're buying our it products for you know single sign on or device management and we're saying hey look um you know you should also be using our recruiting software applicant tracking system or um we see that you have employees in India we have an Indian payroll system so even if you might be a us-based company you can actually use rip Lane to manage your employees in India to pay them to do all that kind of stuff we handle all the money movement and taxes and withholdings and all that kind of stuff um and so we can sort of sell these sort of new SKS to the same customers and deepen their relationship with us um and it's interesting I mean we've built um you know there's a lot of there are a lot of things that we do from a sales perspective to make that work um one is we tend to really we try and Shard our sales organization so we have um in addition to just the new logo the AES that sell rip Lane sort of like the overall package to new prospective customers we have individual product sales organizations that come in that sell are focused on just one product you know where we have like you know our Global sales team that sells Global capabilities for companies that are you know have employees you know outside of the country that their headquarters are in we have our spend management team that sells sells things like corporate cards expense reimbursements bill pay corporate travel software you know we have a team that sells our talent Suite you know applicant tracking uh Performance Management that kind of stuff and I have a question there right like sorry to interrupt you but important question this sales team what are they doing on a daily basis like what's the sales team structured like what's a pod look like and what are the activities they're doing are they going and meeting these clients physically are they sending out call emails are they going back channeling through through messaging saying hey do you have an intro to this VP like how do you how do you close a new client well so usually what what the an account executive is taking over once we have an interested Prospect so someone wants to get on the phone learn more take a demo it's almost all inside sales so it's so it's all marketing till that point till the point it's marketing until that point um we do have an outbound sales motion that's a different team sdrs that that do cold calling but a lot of it is actually marketing driven um to sort of get people to the point where they take a demo um and then what will happen is an account executive will get on the phone with a prospect um and they'll sort of pitch them on the overall Rippling Vision because every client's coming to us usually with a very specific need they'll say you know uh man it's a lot of work for me every time I hire a new employee to set them up in all these different systems that I use in my company um and I heard you guys have a solution for that I know you guys also do payroll I don't want to I don't want to touch my payroll system I'm happy with that I don't want to move this other stuff but can you help me solve this problem and we we'll try and talk to them in that call and say look this problem that you believe that you have around managing user access in all of your different sort of business applications we can solve that for you we have you know an identity product that that manages user provisioning and single sign on across all these system systems but really this problem at a more fundamental level the problem is actually about the fragmentation of employee data within your company that you have 20 different systems that need to understand who your employees are and this is One symptom of that deeper underlying disease um and if you let us solve that for you at a more fundamental level we could solve these like 15 other problems for you that you didn't come to talk to us about today but that we could run you through the list and you probably have those problems too and and so frequently customers come to us with like one thing that they want but they buy a whole Suite of services because they buy into that Vision um but usually they buy some but not everything and then what happens is then later on down the line you know the other teams are are sort of calling into them and saying like hey look you know you know you guys um you guys didn't you know are you interest you've hit a size now where maybe it makes sense to set up like an a recruiting software for example um we can help you do that or it makes sense to set up performance management software are you interested in talking to us about that sort of thing so if I'm a founder and I join ripling today let's say I built a company and didn't work out I've been through the grind for three years and I join ripling and then I say hey um Parker I have this great idea for a cly competitor these are all the benefits it has for Enterprises and I build that let's say you you say okay and we build that over like let's say a year what's the kind of user base that that calendar like product could get access to about people so it used to be I mean I'll give you the progression um so um you know when we started doing this you know maybe a couple years ago um we would we would launch products and consistently the new products that we would launch would get to a million in run rate Revenue in a year now the products that we've launched most recently like in the last year 12 to 18 months could you give me an example uh of a product we launched last 12 to 18 months yeah um well one is our ATS product so it's recruiting software for recruiting teams another is our Global products that that you we that are for companies to manage employees outside of their home country um so you know things like payroll benefits Administration you know local sort of compliance in in those markets um those products now every single one of them makes it to a million in run rate Revenue in month zero like the month that it launches um and the record is actually our Global products um when we launched them about uh like 15 months ago they went from 0 to 12 million in AR in four months so it's like literally this just massive uptick in a very short period of time and that's that's SDR sending out emails or is it just you have one Central email list and you're like hey here's now we have ads well so some of it is um some of it is now you know all of the new prospects that we're talking to got it um all of them now are presented with hey here's you know are you interested in like adding a recuit recruiting software and many of them will say actually that's you know I should I should add that on like that becomes a part of the package that they buy but actually what a lot of it is is like an internal ad system that we've built um that's basically you can think of it as like the Facebook ad exchange The Way businesses buy ads on Facebook and the thing that I think makes the Facebook ad exchange work so well um is that um the social graph is like the right underly primitive for selling consumer products so you can go in you can Target People based on their interest based on you know all kinds of different things and say like oh you know this is maybe this is a good person to sell you know mobile phones to for example I actually think that the employee graph the data about the internal organization is the right underlying primitive for selling business software um and so we can Target people very precisely and we might say look here's a company they just posted a job uh for someone in Bangalore um you know it's a US company but they're they're looking to hire someone in Bangalore like we have like a whole Suite of products for you know payroll in India for you know managing employees in India we should reach out to them and sell them that or you know we can say look here's a company that just hired their first recruiter um they probably need you know recruiting software or um you know they hit a certain size where um you know they they maybe they have remote employees um but they don't buy our they haven't bought our it management uh warehousing software so we have we have a basically a a thing that that we call Inventory management that gives you like basically a virtual Warehouse I mean our our warehouse is very real but it's virtual to you where when you terminate a remote employee we send them a box and a shipping label and they can put their computer in the box and it ships it back to our warehouse where we store it and clean it and wipe it and so it's ready to go and then the next time you hire an employee you don't have you can just sort of choose that computer from our warehouse we ship it back out to them so if you have you know maybe someone terminates a remote employee and we're like how are you getting their computer back we can help with that maybe you should buy this service um so those are the kinds of things that those are all very marketing driven we have like a whole like growth team that does most companies their growth team are focused on using systems like you know Google or Facebook or like other types of sort of paid marketing channels to acquire new logos like new customers we have a team that does that but we also have an equally large team that just uses our own internal ad system to generate demand from existing customers for new ripling products got it so give me some rough numbers right like how many conversations are let's say the sales reps doing on a on a monthly like you know it depends a lot on the team um because some depending on the size you know a lot of the these the sales teams are segmented by customer size and then by product and so depending on depending on sort of you know reps that go after larger companies tend to sort of work with fewer prospects at a time and you know reps that work with very small businesses often do like a ton of the so you know it it rang you know at the high end you know maybe you know there are 10 demos a month you know sort of new prospects that that reps sort of take onto their calendar at the high end it could be you know 3540 got it and out of those 354 you have maybe three four conversions a month something like that oh I think it it's higher than that I mean we um you know for in our in our SMB segment you know they they I actually don't I don't know up handw the conversion rates are right now so I'm kind of like making this up but I but I think it's like 30 to 40% that they end up winning interesting and is India like a big market for you guys well it depends so India is not a huge market for us we don't um we don't sell SAS software to Indian companies for the most part is that a reason we' we've struggled with it we've kind of looked at it a little bit um some of it is the price point um you know the the company's oriented around selling software a price point that often Indian businesses look at that and they're like I don't want to pay that much money for software um and and we're not set up to sell software at a price point that would make sense for a lot of for a lot of Indian businesses um it's just hard if your cost structure is set up around this price point to sell at a very different one and make it work um so that that's probably the main reason but India is a very important market for us for a number of reasons one is just there's an enormous employee base that we have in India one um but two um India is one of the biggest markets for our Global products so we we weirdly we I think we have a great sort of payroll and HR System for Indian employees so we you know I I run payroll for you know everyone that works for Rippling in India there's you know roughly 700 or so employees and I run payroll in ripling and and it manages you know payroll benefits you know food coupons like all that kind of stuff for our employees in Bangalore and we sell that product actually usually primarily to non-indian businesses that have employees in India um and India is obviously one of our most popular um U sort of countries for that Global product um so businesses all around the world you know have offices and locations in India um so I think the top one for us is Canada because we're headquartered in the US and there's a lot of you know lot of Us Canada um but then I think India is number two and then you know after that it's the UK and then you know Australia and sort of France Germany places like that you know you know digressing here but sometimes I go on Twitter right and there'll be this like really young kid uh who you know points at a Founder he's like hey this Founder's made a mistake or this founder is not doing well or this company's going to die and when I was young I was like oh that's interesting Insight right but as gotten older I was like it's like 3 seconds to put out a tweet but building a company takes like 5 six years and having built companies myself and having been through like really really hard times and you know it's just hard running a company I can't imagine what it would have been like to run a company and then have to move out of that one and do it again so are you comfortable talking about the Zenit story and everything that transpired there yeah sure I mean I I like you know it's not the most fun but but uh but uh definitely like happy to to jump into it yeah is that an insight you had towards the end of zenitz where you're like you would have done things differently you know I think there there are a few things um the biggest one was actually was just like very unrelated to the headlines around zenitz and like in a lot of ways like probably sort of boring and unexciting but one of the big mistakes that we made was that early on at zenefits um I think the the Insight that we had was that um was that companies you know had before zenefits businesses had in the United States multiple different systems related to HR so they would they would have an HR System but then separately they need to enroll employees in a bunch of different lines of health insurance like Medical in in the US like the the way this works as medical benefits are provided directly by your employer um dental vision life disability but then also retirement what would be pensions in in India um you know Provident funds is is something called a 401k in the United States um and these were all just completely separate systems that that people would manage and we sort of said look we're going to give you one button that you click to hire someone and we're going to send out offer letters employment agreements um you know get all the right documents signed uh and then we're going to set them up with all of these different systems and all of this different access and all these different benefits and you just have like one button that you need to click to sort of make this happen and that was you know this like and by the way it's it's going to be free because we make all this money sort of on the insurance side um and and uh we had sort of uncovered this like great kind of like product Market fit um and everything worked so well for us like we would just um you know my my the company that I did before zenefits nothing ever worked for us like we would we would try and find a way to get customers and we would have five or six things that we would try that we were sure these these would have to work there was no way that this wouldn't work and they would all fail except for like one of them that would kind of like sort of half maybe kind of like a little bit Market Fish yeah and then and then at zenefits we would everything that we tried would work um and it was almost like too easy to get new customers and the big fear that we had was that actually it was so easy that that there were all these other companies that started pivoting into our space that were like okay these guys have found something that works and so everyone was sort of moving into that area every B2B founder in India at some point he said I'll build his benefits for India is that right oh that's interesting only those cires like benefits for India it's an open opportunity yeah so what everyone sort of moved in started moving in the space and we thought look the only way what we have to do is we have to take all the oxygen out of the room so we have to suck up all the demand find every customer get bigger faster than all of these others sort of second movers that are moving quickly into the space because at some level of scale there will be some Network effects to this business but if if we sort of take it slow if we don't put the gas pedal all the way to the floor then like someone else is going to be the one to kind of get to that scale we're going to lose this thing that we sort of stumbled upon um and so one of the critical decisions that I made early on that was really a mistake in retrospect was you said look you know we need to scale the commercial activities of the company ahead of the underlying engineering capabilities and so we said all of these companies have there's this big administrative burden that they have managing all these different systems we're just going to take that administrative burden on we're going to kind of do things manually for them behind the scenes and we'll work to sort of automate it over time um and the problem is is that um we ended up scaling up this sort of manual operation to sort of handle a lot of the these internal business Ops administrative issues and then there a lot of people and then people is liability people well people people just are are they let you down they're you know it's hard um you know people make mistakes um so you can't you know our clients were expecting like a software system that was Flawless and instead there were there was human error behind the scenes and that led to this sort of sense in the market that like you know the idea behind zenefits is great but there's just a lot of execution problems um and once that became the conventional wisdom about the company sort of everything that was working so well for us top of funnel it all disappeared and went away um and it happened at like exactly the wrong moment you know right after we'd raise a huge amount of money at a very high price um and so we were you know growth was collapsing we were upside down on Gross margins because of how expensive it was to have all of these people doing doing this sort of manual Ops work um and it it was all at the right time and it was in that context that I think you know a lot of this sort of stuff about you know compliance started coming out and I think um you know like the investors really I used that as sort of an excuse to sort of say like maybe let's like switch things up get rid of Parker or see if someone else you know see if the COO the sort of you know old hand at this can come in and sort of like that was davidx that was David yeah um and I mean it didn't it didn't work very well for them like David I think sort of was kind of like the dog that catches the car and then like doesn't know what to do with it you know and sort of like suddenly he was running the company which is I think what he wanted to be doing or what he thought he wanted to be doing but then sort of like lost interest um and uh and kind of ran the thing into the ground um and then um and then from there you know he moved on about a you know a year year and a half later um and in the meantime you know I sort of said look once once I left it the the like um you know I I felt like David was making all the wrong decisions he he he cut all the wrong product initiatives he you know fired all the wrong people he promoted all the wrong people and I sort was like this thing is not going to work um and so I started um with Pana who was um one of you know my my sort of close colleagues its benefits um started Rippling um and said look we're going to this is an extension of what we were trying to do at zenefits and at zenefits the idea was you know allinone HR software you know taking sort of giving employers one place to go to deal with all this HR stuff and and sort of towards the end of my time at zits I kind of had this realization that for the same reason that employers wanted one system to kind of manage all the HR stuff they actually wanted one system for much more than that and I started realizing that fundamentally employee data and the employee record it wasn't it it was actually like a primitive for a lot of business software um that there were all these areas that we don't think of as HR where employee data was critical to the operation of these software systems you know it was any system with permissions you know those permissions are much more powerful if they can be role-based permissions um any system with reporting and analytics anytime you're looking at business data of any kind you want to cut and slice and dice that data by role you know you want to look at it by Department by manager by work location you want to filter out your interns and you know drill down on this specific kind of area and look at it by tenure and and and so you're you're constantly taking business data from all these other systems and joining it back to the underlying employee data and that that's actually one of the things that I think makes analytic systems very powerful um anytime you have approvals approvals who needs to approve something for an employee well first of all depends on who they are you know VPS need different approvals than it's complicated and and you get to simplify it with software yeah and well it's not just that you simplify it with software it's that this mixing in of this understanding of who your employees are and their job and role and function simplifies and allows you to build better products in all of these different unrelated areas you build better it software better finance software you know maybe some way someday even like better sales software interesting and I I picked up a piece of startup gold from there you you have to tell me whether it's gold you found pmf I mean you spent years not finding pmf and you tried everything then you tried the same things but you had pmf and it worked and then you had this realization that well if we don't pull all demand and bring it here somebody else is going to eat that market yeah is that always true you get pmf and then you have to hit the accelerator raise money capture all the demand or do you give away pieces of your Market to other people well I think so what um I was talking about the I I I left off the second part of the story which is you know the thing that we did differently at rip Lane was the opposite we said look we're not we're gonna we're going to take a much longer time to build this um but when we build it it's going to be software end to end and so you know for a long time the company was you know basically me and mostly a whole bunch of really sizable engineering team you know 40 or 50 Engineers getting this this to the point where you know everything sort of worked and worked really well and was software and end and then um you know and then and then things took off from there um I think that like what what I got wrong at zenefits is that you know the the market didn't turn over as quickly as I expected you know we thought um zenitz was really competing with insurance brokers in the United States um and we thought that the entire Market the insurance brokerage Market was going to turn over in 5 years that it would be like you know in in the US there used to be when you wanted to book travel you'd go and you talk to a travel agent you know like a per you pick up the phone and call someone and they would they would book your travel for you and then of course things moved online and travel agents basically disappeared um in favor of online services and we thought the same thing was going to happen with insurance brokers um and it was going to happen very very quickly and it happened you know you know first of all it hasn't actually it hasn't happened but to the extent that there was a transition it was much slower than I initially expected um and so we probably could have taken the time to sort of like really focus on the software and the R&D investment for a little longer and get it right and sort of nail it before scaling up the sales and marketing uh machine and the only reason you hit the pedal there was because you thought competition was inbound yeah I mean it was it was um I mean I you know I had you know the psychology of it is that I you know I had seen so many years of failure um yeah that suddenly when something was working it was like oh my God is this thing going to sort of slip from my grasp you know you need to you need to go after it and grab it um and I think a lot of Founders who have you know who know that struggle who have seen you like how hard it is to get something to work yeah suddenly have just like such some combination of desperation and appreciation for things suddenly and fear that you lose it and fear of what it could be if it Slips Away um and so I think I think you know I don't I don't know Travis well but I'm I'm told that like that was a lot of like Travis's sort of psychology at Uber um and um um and so I think you know that that's a powerful motivator for second time Founders um yeah not losing the market yeah parak you've done things multiple times right like you you now had two success stories and and I think what you were when you were maybe 20 and today there might be a lot of changes a lot of things you've learned but also what I've come to learn is to make a million dollars you need the kind of person who can make a million dollars right to to run a billion dollar company multiple times there's something there's a way you think that other people don't and I'm sure you have wisdom that's inside that head that is different from uh conventional wisdom right where you would disagree with the VC on certain points let's say or you disagree with other Founders on certain points is there a framework you have like if I had to ask you what is Parker Conrad's set of Secrets right or differences from the average person that's made him who he is today what would you put that down as and the easy way to ask this question is you've seen that Meme where there's this guy and there's like thousand he's surrounded by thousands of sworts and the question is what's an opinion you have that other people would you know be like this like they theyd come up and hold a sword to your throat like one of these for example is the fact that you don't believe in the idea of radical Focus anymore yeah or it's it's not that I I think that that I that I don't believe in Focus it's it's that I think that there are opportunities that we miss you know because of this assumption that you have to start with something very narrow um I mean that's probably the thing that was like sort of the most kind of heterodox Viewpoint that that I had around how to build these businesses like when when ripling was getting started um um I I mean I think they're I'm trying to think like what else do I like disagree with people on it could also be differences in your life right for example I met this one founder who's like The Secret of My Success is I don't eat carbohydrates which is it probably doesn't apply to everybody else sucks it's probably very unique to him right life is not worth living at that point it's probably very unique to him but like this is an open space so I can I can to give a few things I'm um I'm I'm very skeptical of the idea of like investor value ad in companies um um I think that most investors most investor involvement is actually very dangerous for companies um just because like it I think it's dangerous to have people who are incredibly smart and capable who have like a few hours a quarter of context about your company like it almost never goes well like their opinions are almost always wrong um um so like my my preference is for like as little investor involvement as possible like I think VCS generally talk about how you want to pick great investors that are going to help you and like I think that's like a very scary Prospect of like of of having that um so that that's probably one area of disagree although I love my my current investors at rip Lan and and I think they're they're great um another thing is I'm I'm like skeptical of um being like too like data driven at at organizations like I I tend to think that like um it's really hard to figure out what's going on like top down looking at dashboards um and actually I think that like anec data tends to be a lot more powerful than data which is anecdote Plus data yeah you usually just anecdotes actually like I think that if you want to know if something's going wrong in sales and you want to know what's going wrong in sales usually like you could stare at any number of dashboards and you'd never figure it out um and the right the right thing to do is actually probably to go like sit on sit in on the next 10 to 20 sales calls with prospective customers and like you're going to know exactly what's wrong at that point um and you know if something's not working in support you need to go um you know go read the last sort of 10 or 15 support interactions and see like what happened um you know if there's an Ops process that's broken you need to go sit and do it like as the Ops person for a day um and figure out like why is this like screwed up um and the reason that like data is sort of often unsatisfying is like you know when you when you have data it it shows you to the the answers to the questions that you know to ask and when things are broken it's usually broken because there's something that you don't it's the the sort of unknown unknowns that cause problems it's not captured in the data it's not captured in the data um because it's you know you're not looking at that specific thing it's not instrumented in that particular way and so you need to go look at like individual like anomalies and sort of like and and then you sort of look at a few of them and you immediately understand what's going on um and so that I mean that's another another sort of piece of conventional wisdom that I think I generally disagree with um I'm trying to think what else um I think that like um I um I probably tend to um like one one thing I don't know how like different this is but um like iend tend to be very skeptical of like tradeoffs um so um in inside the company like people often come to me and and do what I call like CEO in a box um where they where where they'll say like okay you can have like a or b like which one do you want like a or b um and often these trade-offs are framed as like speed versus quality or um you know speed versus feature completeness or you know something like that um and my response is usually when I get that like a versus B tradeoff is to say to say like wait hold on like time out um I want both A and B like why why can I not have a and b um and usually what's happening is like the person that's bringing you that decision is actually all making the decision for you they're deciding that like these are the constraints that they're imposing on the problem and giving you sort of the illusion of choice um when usually like you can sort of say look why where is is it written that A and B cannot coexist you know where like does it violate the second law of Thermodynamics like what's the what's the reason that you can't have these two things at the same time um and often you can find like a third path like you can find a different approach um you can find a way to get both of them um speed versus quality is like my favorite one because like I've I have seen many many engineering teams that move slowly have never known them to build high quality products um and so but everyone believes that like secretly you or not everyone believes that like it's like speed versus quality is this thing and it's almost always like moving slow is almost always correlated with like very low quality outputs at the same time um off you know definitely people can move fast and build bad products but like like almost never is like moving slowly like the answer to like building high quality things interesting uh last question right and this is on talent management I find it hard like in the past to run like a 4050 man Aug right you you have what like thousand employees like what's the what's the about 2500 2500 employees how do you how do you hire people what's your frame what are your red flags so when when I so most of the time when when I'm when I'm hiring someone it's usually someone in an executive role um um and and so you know this there different ways I think there are different things that are appropriate for hiring people at different levels but usually what um what I do when I'm hiring an exec is I'll send them a bunch of material about the company um you know stuff that I prepared you know for investors for you know youve written those things yeah so there's a you know usually like once a year I sit down and write an investor memo um that's sort of like almost like the the manifesto for the company like what are what are we doing why how does the business work what's the strategy um and I I usually like we I have written that memo and like often like not used it to raise money because like you know we weren't we weren't raising money that year and instead it ends up like being used almost exclusively for for recruiting do those memos get leaked to to the media and stuff we we published we actually published the first one um and I don't think the the subsequent ones I don't think have have leaked and we haven't we haven't published them um we we send them out pretty broadly to perspective can you don't mind if the competitors see it yeah and I I think we're sort of like like I sort like the the the the the there was a point where I realized like At first we were like very secretive about it and there was a point where I realized like you know what it's if other people see this competitors like there there's nothing that they that they can do about it and so like it's actually okay like even if if people if it leaks um but I'll send them all that material and we'll set up a call and and generally I'll say like look I have I have no agenda I have I have no questions for you it's really like this is your chance to sort of ask me about the company and the business and the role um and we'll just sort of start a conversation and uh generally what I'm looking for is I want to learn something in the course of that conversation um so like the best interviews are things where people like you know they they they have first of all usually very smart questions and the smart question are like the really bad ones are the ones that start off where people are just kind of like how are you so amazing you know like like you built such an amazing company and like that it's like sort of like okay that's not you know that person's probably not going to work out um but the the the really good people are people that have that can really get right to the sort of central issues on like well I I it's interest you know they sort of say look it's interesting how you're thinking about this but how do you handle this problem and like isn't it going to break because of this reason um and you know these are usually things that I've thought about before and so you know I have answers to like sort of those those Central questions um but like I also know that they're like the right objections versus like there are stupid objections and there are smart objections and some people get right to the really smart objections um and we have a conversation about that and often like in those conversations like I'll learn something new or they'll have advice you you know about sort of you know if I'm interviewing someone for like I don't know engineering they'll have they'll have a point of view on the engineering side around some of the challenges and how you might address them and sometimes they'll be like whoa like that's a really that's a really smart Point um and so and generally if I if I learn something from them that's almost always like someone that I want to hire so it's like you put out a document where you're like hey here's what the company does here's here are my expectations and then what you judging execs for when you're hiring them is Clarity of thought yeah I think I think that's right and and like can they can they can they challenge me on on my thinking and do I learn something about sort of you know how how their function should operate from that conversation um and some people and then and then also like you know everyone's going to start out they're not going to totally I mean I've spent a lot more time thinking about this than they have so they usually are going to have questions and some people in the course of that conversation they're were they're sort of like completing my sentences they're kind of like oh you know you they're like oh yeah and that means this or they see the implications you know where they're like oh okay if that's if that's true then also this and also that and that means that the following and they're you they just get it really quickly um and it's sort of I think those people tend to be very Su because that's actually the most natural interaction that we're going to have and you're hiring EX for judgment anyway that's right you know you want you want people where sort of like they're going to they're going to immediately sort of like fit into a Groove get in a Groove and sort of understand you know move get Beyond you know you want people who are going to see ahead of of you on this stuff like once they they're going to pick it up and they're going to see sort of around the corner on this and so you want people that in that first conversation that tends to be kind of how they're operating and any red flags when you're hiding exx but like that's a that's a no goal red flags um usually people who are kind of you know the first conversation they uh you know want to know about work life balance or you know like so you know there's like that that's sort of usually like not that you know that's not a thing but if that you know that's probably not the first you know the first conversation I have this Theory by the way that like actually um um that like the that one of the sort of interesting ways to judge a company is um if you look at Glass Door reviews they're like highly correlated um with sort of people's answers on work life balance um what does that mean I mean could you explain it in a simpler way for the audience the Glass Door reviews and the um there's a score that that is on glass door for the company as a whole and there's a score for work life balance um and I think that actually the best companies are ones where the uh the difference between those two scores is really telling because there's a high correlation between those scores but I think you want to work for companies where sort of like the um you know that the the the company rating is much higher than the work life balance you know that people are like look the company's like working really well in comparison to like the amount of work that it is um to be there yeah it's a nice place to work but hey you can't expect perfect work life balance yeah it's like look um you know you want I think you want companies to be like um you you want to be livable like you know I have three kids I take my kids to school every morning um you know read them read them a story at night before they go to bed but also like I think you want to work somewhere where there's some ambition and there's um there are other people with sort of a chip on their shoulder that want to get something done um you know like we're not um you know no one no one's here on this this planet forever and like you know you you know it's a short short time that we have and you want to I think you want to try and accomplish something um and sometimes people think that they want to work at a company um where there's really good work life balance and a lot of times people end up at those companies they don't like it and then the problem is is like you end up at that company and you know everyone else around you doesn't give a you know they're kind of phoning it in um and and that ends up being really frustrating you know if you're someone who's motivated and ambitious like you want to be somewhere where your colleagues are all you know really care you know you have a sense of popus yeah exactly um and that look can be a lot of work but also very inspiring and engaging and exciting at the same time um when you have an environment like that yeah one last thing I picked up from this conversation is you seem to write a lot is there like a correlation between quality writing and you know General startup success um I don't know I don't I mean I don't know if I I like I I find it really hard and painful to write I think that like you know like doing the investor memo thing like frequently what happens is like the business gets ahead of like the last memo and so like the last memo is kind of out of date now because like things have evolved and there there's more to the story than what's reflected there and so I get a lot of pressure from my team to like update it and it just like it takes like months for me to like do it I'm supposed to be doing one right now um how many pages is the is the memo I usually about like like 20 Pages or so um and like I was supposed to be doing it on the flight over I was supposed to be doing it while I'm here you know in in Bangalore and have some downtime I've done absolutely nothing you know the the and like and the reason is like you sit there and you kind of like stare at the screen and until your eyes start to bleed and like you know and suddenly and hopefully like a like the memo comes out and I find it like very very difficult um and then and so usually there's sort of like like a long like months of that until finally it's like there's some deadline and I only have like this weekend to finish College all over again yeah and it it all comes out in like this sort of like Torrid like manic sort of like like heavily caffeinated weekend of just like locking myself in a room and like you know sort of sitting there until until so that's like the only way that I found a right um yeah so I don't I don't think of myself as particularly good at it I think of it as like extremely painful and then eventually you know it just kind of you squeeze it out somehow interesting interesting thank you so much Bak I think I learned a lot I think I learned a little more on how I should probably run a company when I do it next and I think that I'm sure that the people who stayed so far have learned a lot do you have any last message for them before we bid aduk um for for like listeners um yeah I'm trying to think um I think um I think ripling is a really special company in ways that are not evident from the outside because I think ripling looks like from the outside like an HR software company and a lot of people are like uh HR software that's boring and I think people shouldn't think of it that way we're really saying like look we have like a fundamentally new approach to how you should build software and employee data is like a fundamental building block of sort of I think how a lot of software should be built um and and so I think that like particularly for for many of your listeners like they should they should check us check us out and come uh you know come see if it might be good fit awesome if you're in India and you're looking for a job and you have been in the startup ecosystem where did they go ding.com jobs I Ripley there's a career I don't even know what the URL is but yeah Ripley figure it out you'll figure out in the footer there's a link there um you know we're hiring tons of people growing very aggressively how many people are you hiring in India you have a rough number um we I know that on the engineering side we're hiring roughly a hundred people in just in Bangalore next year but then we're also hiring sales and marketing product design um you know we're hiring Finance Customer Support about 300 jobs at minimum guys go get it exactly awesome thank you Bako and I hope you had fun thanks a bunch that was fun"}

{"video_id": "B6lHomRD7C0", "title": "Why Rabbit R1 Won&#39;t Work!", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6lHomRD7C0", "transcript": "over the last week many people have sent me videos of the rabbit R1 and they've asked me vun what are your thoughts on this and to summarize I'm very bullish about the company and the team but not so much on the product before we get into why let me just quickly summarize the rabbit R1 for you it's a device with a speaker screen mic and all the AI stuff that it's actually running which is the large action model is online it's running it on the cloud so it doesn't need powerful processing now if it doesn't need powerful processing you can can bring the price down so this is a device that costs $199 roughly 16,000 rupees and it's much much cheaper than a phone and a lot of people have said it's so much cheaper than a phone so why not their value ad is a large action model like I said which is used to sort of use apps by figuring out how to navigate through the app by itself and making the final purchase or order for you which means if you want to book a cab all you have to do is say I need to book a cab to this place and it will do that for you it also has a training mode which allows you to teach it new skills so you wanted to use any new type of app in the way you use it you can train the device and all of this is really cool it also looks like a very polished device but this is why I'm not a big fan a lot of people keep saying hey this is a $199 replacement to the phone and it has no distractions no apps no content Etc they are wrong see I've been following the debate around AI devices quite closely and I think there's some misunderstanding from some people on what a smartphone actually does people think the value of a modern smartphone is in using utility apps like booking a cab or ordering food or whatever this is true but it is in the power use case if you look at the average human screen time if you look at your screen time 90% of your usage will be consuming content images text and video when you use WhatsApp also it's images and text that you're consuming most of the time so I'll tell you how most humans use the phone there's this book I read along long time ago called Brave New World it's also a TV series it's written by Alis Huxley and that book is about a futuristic Society right so what they do is they carry with them a bunch of drugs they call the drug soma it's a drug you pop every few hours to ease your boredom and anxiety and every time they feel even a little bit bored or anxious they pop the drug most of us consume content in periodic intervals on our phones as a way to do exactly this as a way to load up on dopamine and the minute the ability of a user to explode and consume content which is consume these drugs is removed it becomes a pure utility device with 5 minutes of usage time per day so even though a lot of people on the internet will virtue signal they'll be like I want to get off I want to stop Doom scrolling I want to stop watching reals they don't actually do that because even today you can delete the Instagram app you can delete the Twitter app and many of you actually end up deleting the apps but you always reinstall it it's a drug and we are all very good at virtue signaling by saying we want to get off this we don't want to do this but our buying Behavior our screen time usage patterns all dictate that we are addicted to the drug of consuming content and that's where 5 to 6 hours of your time goes per day the minute you bring out a device and you say we don't have that a lot of people think they want that but then they stop using it after a while so it's got a lot of hype the first Cycles might sell but after that people are going to go back to their phones and start consuming this content in micro drips like we always do by removing the main dop provider you have a device that's far less useful something you'll use once in a while which is not good for the device manufacturer the second thing about money it's much cheaper people say that's true but almost everyone in the world today already has a smartphone it's not like the market doesn't have a replacement device that people already have so the switching factor to this new device becomes weak now they're sold out but that's because of early hype remember at some point the cheap Micromax phones from India were making a billion dollars in Revenue a year now they are making less than 10% of that finally Android and iOS are definitely going to have Lambs which is the large action models or something similar in fact right after rabbit's announcement an open source version was spun up there is zero software differentiation in AI now you build something a decent team out there can build it next week and an open source team will build it next month and give it to free for everyone it's just a matter of time at CES for example which is the Consumer Electronics Show lots of cars show showed how chat GPT is now in the car same thing will happen here if the large action models are good they will be in Android and iOS soon enough one thing I've learned the hard way is not to battle with the Giants they have too much money Superior research and marketing and that's hard to compete with you need to find gaps they suck at as Peter theel says competition is for losers and rabbit ran just walked into an arena full of competition there is one pro though one reason they might win one thing I've noticed these days is that sales now now has become all about attention positive or negative PR doesn't matter most people actually have $16,000 or $199 of disposable income and if something has hype it'll sell enough to make the team Rich it's still really good-look as a collector's product I'm also very confident the team will build most products most Hardware companies start with one thing and then eventually do another thing you gain experience with the first one and then the second thing comes out really well so I'm very bullish on the team if they can pull it off once they can pull it off multiple times I'm also very wary of looking at a young small team trying some new experiment and saying things like it's not going to work because I know how fragile early startups are and the more negative feedback you get the more you feel like quitting so I don't want to be the person in the ecosystem who says this is not going to work the product they're building today might not be a big leap over what currently exists but I'm very sure the second version of the third version will have enough differentiators lastly one thing is that the device looks gorgeous the rabbit R1 company partnered with teenage engineering which is a very very well-known consumer electronics designer from Sweden and I'll make a full video on teenage engineering I think they deserve one the era of high quality interaction design in the world of Hardware is beginning welcome to that future"}

but I think the definitely the media has come after you media was criticizing influencers for promoting crypto 1 month later they're promoting cryptocurrencies the interpretation of the se's consultation paper is that you cannot promote direct stocks or direct mutual funds in exchange for money do you think there's new content formats in finance that are untapped I think it's kind of saturated if you ask me when I created content I knew less than 1% of what I know today a lot of things came because I was forced to learn new things to create content I try to keep emotions as much as possible away from my money decisions what's the Creator to entrepreneur Arc been like most people think that okay Sharon has 2 million followers on Instagram it's not my followers it's at the end of the day still Instagram's followers the day that the company employee starts talking like you that's when you know you've done a good job so ladies and gentlemen we have a very special guest today this is finance with Sharon Sharon heg my story with Sharon goes back a few years I met him when he had just started to pick up as a content creator he was planning to do an MBA his life path was going to be very different from what it it is today from there to the journey he's had now which is him becoming an entrepreneur running an organization I think has been spectacular to watch from the outside and he's also been through his fair share of ups and downs in fact over the last year the finance Creator versus Media battle has been escalating and Sharon has been at the Forefront of that uh taking all the punches and also Landing some punches of his own So today we're here to hear his story hear his thoughts on the future ladies and gentlemen welcome to another episode of OnePlus open conversations [Music] CH let's start by talking about houses now I keep going on Instagram I'll keep scrolling and then suddenly you'll pop up on my feed and it'll always be you and some Media company right where they've got a mug shot of you they've got you in the place saying houses are bad don't buy houses now I know you and you've come home several times right and we've had this conversation about houses where you've actually had the need to be nuanced about it and I'm not going to do the evil thing of just clipping you out and saying don't buy house yeah I'm sure there are exceptions to buying a house so the my first question for you is give me five reasons you would buy a house why should somebody buy a house I know there are infinite reasons not to buy a house I'll go with mine first I think buying a house gives you a lot of psychological safety everything that I've ever bought in my life is purely emotional purchase even the things that seem rational it was an emotional purchase even when you order food there are plenty of options but you order things that feel more appetizing right um and I think houses in my opinion give you buying a house gives you that psychological safety I know my mom I think 20 years ago uh she bought a house it was on loan she was just like it's psychological safety for me because I already have kids give you give me your opinion on this I think um two reasons what I can think of why somebody would or I would buy a house uh the number one reason is that I have a lot of money right I have already taken care of the basic Financial necessities of life meaning I have saved enough money for funding all my lifestyle expenses like maybe you know a car you know vacations whenever I buy a car before the house of course yeah I mean I own a car right now right and because it's a significantly uh smaller purchase in terms of amount it dwarfs a house when I mean a car I don't mean like a you know 50 lak MK you mean like something 78 l i mean like a 78 lak car right can can be lower as well a three four like high 10 as well right because that really really changes the quality of a lifestyle significantly um the second uh yeah I mean there's lifestyle expenses like car you know ordering out food whenever you want going out for vacations if and your kids education your own Financial Independence if all of that is done which is typically like you know five to six CR Mark and beyond that if you have another 10 15 crows be my be my guess you know buy a house the second reason I would um recommend someone to to buy a house is if they are not really financially sound and disciplined what I mean by that is the only uh positive effect of not buying a house is that you do not spend the saved up money right like see if you buy a one CR house in Bangalore it's an 880,000 Emi versus renting a 1 CR house would be like a 30 35,000 rupees rent that Delta which is 40 45,000 now if you're a financially sound person you will invest that Delta uh if you're somebody who uh feels like you know I'm not going to be uh able to control the money that's coming into my bank account right A lot of people um spend way more than they can just because money is available in the savings account uh but if you're somebody who is very financially sound money coming into my savings account there's an automatic sip going into mutual funds these kind of people should uh will will actually make full benefit of not buying a house um and I think vast majority of the people will are not in this bracket if you ask me um take credit cards for example example such a simple product you spend whatever you can spend and then return the money back at the end of the month half of the money that a credit card company makes are from people who cannot return the money that they've spent because it then gets carried over to the next month and the next month and it becomes a massive credit card that's 50% 50% of a credit card's Revenue comes from that the remaining 50% comes from the uh the merchants in which you are swiping like if you go to big Bazar and swipe that 1 2% money is going to the guard company the remaining half comes from defaulters the defaulters so a large number of people are not financially sound and financially rered because it's not taught to them in schools so I think in these two situations um you should probably buy a house and the last one is kids like you mentioned right once you have kids the whole equation changes um and you do not want to kind of move one house to another house um because then you'll have to move one school to another school um and here again there I mean I think I could manage doing that even if I'm in a a rented house but I'm sure a large number of people would feel the pressure and they'll be like you know [ __ ] it let me just but you don't feel that need for the psychological safety that you know you have a house now you can go aggressive at things you know this is your land of like this is your base of operations and you spend some money on it and you're like okay I'm committing to this for 10 years 20 years whatever it is I think that's a very emotional way of looking at it right I don't look at money as like that right it's at the end of the day it's money house is your money versus investments in mutual funds is a money but do you buy the argument that money is a reflection of um it's basically a reflection of society emotions projected onto goods and services do you feel that way because it's like when I spend money right I'm spending money on something that I want to like I feel a certain way I want to feel psychological safety buying a house and therefore I spend money on it I want to feel like my neighbors and my friends think my child is cool and I am cool that's why I'll throw a big wedding right if you look at at the top spending in India it's like 99% of his is emotional yeah like how do you how do you keep that air gap between what you find emotional and what you think is rational for you according to your reserves I think there's no correct answer to this right emotions control a lot of things I try to keep emotions as much as possible away from my money decisions uh because the more emotions you bring into it the more mistakes you're going to make um the example that you told me that okay if I buy a house I have the financial security to go aggressive um I look at it differently let's say let's say 2 CR house we are in Bangalore 2 CR house now 2 CR in a house versus 2 CR invested in the markets I think I would get more Financial Security with 2 cres invested in the market because once two 2 CR is invested in the markets with anything that I do further on I will still be aggressive because that 2 CR is going to protect me if something happens here whereas in a house 2 CR is in the house now if something bad happens to me I'm going to have to sell the house right how will I how will the house support me if something bad happens to me right it's just going to give me a roof over my head 2 CR is still generating 20 30 lakhs every year which can still pay for my rent and all of my expenses so it's a different way of looking at it people maybe look at 2 cres as a pile of cash I don't look at two CR as a pile of cash I look at it as a uh I look at it as asset invested in high yielding assets which grow faster than house I think it's just the way of looking at it differently interesting this is a question that's that everyone always asks you there's never been a long form answer to this that I've seen mainly because it's shorts and reels they clip it out to a minute yeah so thank you so much for explaining it for everybody I think now there's no an in your answer I mean forget me right who am I to say I mean look at people who are thousand times richer than me they don't have houses I mean you know the Kut Brothers you know nikil Kut he has three houses all on rent right I mean I mean who am I to say don't buy a house look at the people who have more money than then they know what to do with their money they are not buying houses M right so and it's not like they're not enjoying the fruits of big houses you can still rent it and they are you're one of the few creators that's become an entrepreneur like there's a there's a time where I saw you as a Creator like this guy creates Finance content he's creating you know funny content on the internet great but I think over the last 6 eight months you've transitioned to being an entrepreneur and it's a big Journey for you because I also remember the time when you started when we were chatting you were shank's place and you're like I'm going to go do an MBA yeah NBA was the thing going to do right and then your entire career pivoted to okay now I'm a serious Creator to now I'm an entrepreneur right what's the Creator to entrepreneur Arc been like because there are very few people in India that have done it properly and gotten to the scale that you've gotten to I think it was a need of the r uh for the for me definitely for me because if I had continued to be a Creator I was always at the mercy of social media I was that so most people think that okay Sharon has 2 million followers on Instagram um he's is popular and you know his life is sorted and all of that but people don't realize that it's not my followers it's at the end of the day still Instagram's followers uh Instagram has just given me the opportunity to reach out to them just because I'm relevant right now one day when Instagram decides I'm not relevant poof it's gone so I never really owned that distribution do you think there are people at the back of Instagram deciding who's relevant or not or is just purely the audience I think it's purely the audience uh I mean a lot of people uh sort of have this theory that there is this red button which the which Mark zakok likes to press whenever he likes somebody but I don't think it's that I think it's the audience who is sort of making these decisions and it's very very uh subjective and not just that let's say there is this great Creator who is continuously trying to uh you know who's still a great content creator and also improving year on year but what happens is the audience is just gets bored of that person right I'm tired of looking at this person's face right next I would give more of my time space to this fresh new face who is not as good as the previous Creator but I would still like to give an opportunity to this fresh new face uh the underdog right I always want to support the underdog two three years of being a star Creator you're not the underdog anymore right then you are a star right you are a celebrity and nobody likes celebrities if you think about it right very few uh only Sports celebrities are actually loved I think they get a lot of hate too yeah but I'm talking about about if you compare it with an actor or a Bollywood well that's storytelling know if somebody's at the top you want to pull them down if somebody's at the bottom you want to push them up the I mean the media this cyclical thing they they keep doing it's part of their it's part of how you get views both stars get pulled on only when they're not performing but as long as they're performing they are going to get the love but not the same for a Creator if a Creator is still performing well even if they're coming up with very nice information or very nice knowledge they will eventually lose the love of the audience so what I real realized early on is that I cannot continue being a content creator I need to start looking at it as one part of a big business and that is something that you realize as you talk to entrepreneurs once you realize why a brand is coming to you then all the answers start clicking the brand is coming to you not because they are your friends the brand is coming to an influencer because you are a part of their marketing funnel and you drive traffic for them I drive traffic for them they cannot reach out to the Audience by themselves because the audience hates companies because companies are only there to make money so the company will come to me to tell my audience that hey this company is good that is the only reason a company is coming to you so once you start thinking like that then you realize that my followers why why should I expose my followers to other companies why can't I build something of my own which my followers will like because then because it's my own product I will have an advantage over these other companies right other companies are using me as a middleman but building a company is a different ball game right now you got to hire lots of people you've got to build processes you got to raise money if necessary so the transition wouldn't have been easy from Creator to oh now I got to do all these things I think entrepreneurship is the one of the hardest things in the world to do right um not because it's consumes a lot of your time and energy it's just because of the context switching that you have to do you have to do every single thing you have to do all the way from like I I'm I'm weak at Tech but that's not an option I still need to understand Tech in today's world because as an entrepreneur you cannot say that I'm not good at this I'll hire somebody else but it's not as simple as saying I'll hire this person to do everything and I'll just kind of observe it's not going to work you need to understand as much as possible because at the end of the day the vision comes from you uh if you hire a tech person um this person is at best going to be the technician or the implementer the vision still needs to come from you um then be it marketing content is already my strength um getting into sales getting into PR um everything you know everything you need to be doing and at the same time and you need to sort of understand what's happening everywhere that is one thing second thing is the team you cannot do everything by yourself hiring is easy getting people for the first uh week is easy because you give them a salary they come um motivating them to give it their best every single time uh retaining them uh year after year because the real compounding effects of a company comes when the team has stuck around for at least I would say two or years because then the synergies come into play and that's bring but I think most people these days they can't stay in a company for like 2 three years it's hard and it requires you to expend so much energy to keep them together yeah I think it's more than energy it's about um making them part of your vision right making them believe in it as much as you do because the day that the company employees starts talking like you that's when you know you've done a good job because then they're not just working for the salary they're working because they believe in the mission that you are working on see see for an entrepreneur I would say most successful entrepreneurs are not exactly doing it for the money because for an entrepreneur to do what he or she is doing they would have already so for money to some extent because you could wish they're taking these kind of extreme risks think about it right you are raised let's say whatever millions of dollars and then you're working on a okay salary like not that high salary as well because the company is not making money it's pre- revenue and all of that how do you justify a high salary to your investors when your company has not started making money and you're going at it for 6 to 7 years the opportunity cost of that was maybe working for another company at 1 CR plus salary you could have done all of that but you chose to do this and the reason you chose to do this because money doesn't motivate you anymore you already so for money so I think a successful entrepreneur and when I mean Successful entrepreneur somebody who is going to have a pan India uh impact somebody who can at least you know generate maybe 300 400 crores of Revenue needs to really believe in the problem statement that they're trying to solve because money at the end of the like you said is a reflection of the value that you added to the society and that value comes from solving a problem so if you're very deeply passionate about a problem like really really deep not just because it makes you money but because it helps somebody else only then you can you know drive a mission and a vision to it and then align the entire team towards it I think that is more difficult than you know increasing the salary every year and how do you deal with you know there are bunch of people on Twitter for example who will you know tag you and say Sharon look at this guy he just talks about Finance makes funny stuff um and they're doing like a product management role or something in a company right yeah and they feel it's easy and I've seen some of these people actually go out and create content themselves right and then realize actually it's a lot harder a because talking is not the hard part right it's the risk of doing this and the chance of failure is like extremely high and second part is uh the competition is intense like pretty much everyone thinks it's an easy idea so they come start doing it that's the the only time they gain respect do you like when you were an employee I'm sure you were an employee at some point right uh what is something that you never realized back then that you now realize an entrepreneur things you used to say about entrepreneurs SL content creators that uh you just you've taken a complete u-turn on now so I've never really observed the content creator space before I became a content creator see when I started um the world was full of YouTube content creators and there were not a lot of people uh to begin with they were just The ogs Who been around for almost 10 years now so I didn't really you know follow them or study them uh to be honest I start when I started my content creation had I known what other content creators were doing I would not have achieved what I've achieved today because I started from a first principles method right I always thought about the audience and what they wanted um that is why I was able to create a new category right the category being entertainment Plus Finance like had I just studied other content creators and try to replicate them I would not have been you know where I am today so that is one thing second thing when it comes to entrepreneurs I always thought these entrepreneurs are like the you know super super intelligent people very well gifted um not everybody's cup of tea or these guys have you know basically super intelligent people who are uh made of something else The Chosen Few but then now what I realize is that it is not that they are super smart it is just that they are tell they are very good at telling a story to themselves to do it day after day after day because if you ask me right they also have insane risk capacity insane risk capacity is one but I think more than that is to is the ability to uh sort of uh try something new agree I mean accepting that you will suck at it in the beginning uh but still keep at it and while you're doing it you will keep hearing a lot of people saying that it's not possible you cannot do it but even then keep doing it I'll give you my example when I created content I I I mean I I I knew less than 1% of what I know today right a lot of things came because I was forced to learn new things to create content and as I kept creating content sure I created I I got a million followers 2 million followers that was just through distribution then next thing was for me to kind of get into uh like a proper serious educational uh kind of thing right instead of just entertaining the audience can I like hold the attention of my audience for 3 hours where I teach them the full details about personal finance planning so that again you get through that imposter Syndrome again like how can you do it there are better people than you you don't even have a finance degree how are you going to be able to teach better than an MBA Professor or a CA degree or a CFA degree person so these sort of things um keep coming to you and a lot of people don't start just because of this so now what I've realized is that these entrepreneurs are the ones who are uh people who become entrepreneurs are the ones who are constantly learning they realize that they're not the smartest that actually they don't don't really know a lot of stuff but they surround themselves with people who are smarter than them and quickly implement the things that they are learning in their business like a lot of people just read books and like to think you know would like to think of thems as really smart but one week later or two weeks later down the line they don't remember more than 90% of that book uh but I think an entrepreneur is somebody who takes those learnings either from a book or from their real life experiences by talking to other people and implements them in real life situations better than others and just the distance between talking and doing is so far I mean even if your job is to talk like a content creator politician like I used to think when I was younger that these politician running the country they not doing a good job yeah then when I actually started running companies I realized oh [ __ ] imagine running a country they are the smartest people if you politicians are the smartest and the hardest working people of the country if you ask me like but that's a realization you get in your like when you get super old or you get to scale no when you when you think about it like that's again like when we both started off you know let's say from middle class tier of the society and in the middle class tier of the society if you now think about it our parents used to say that you know politicians are you know corrupt people they're not trustworthy they eat a lot of money and all of that right but then now that you are able to see the country from a much more macro view you realize that whatever politicians are doing there is no other way of doing it right in in a country like India cuz someone or the other is going to complain yeah someone or the other is going to complain so it's very easy to sit down here and look up at them and say you know they are bad and all of that like we all criticize people who be who are rich and wealthy right we think their life is so easy and you know why don't they you know help people who are not as fortunate uh but I think it's very easy to complain right one reaching that point whatever these politicians or you know ultra wealthy billionaires are it comes with a lot of U trial and error and a lot of mental stress which we can't even imagine right and if we had to if we want the kind of Life they're having you would I mean it doesn't come in an instant they have to go through some Next Level uh you know mind [ __ ] Journey which we can't even imagine right and most people do not want to take that path and they like to criticize and you can't have an easy family life you can't travel you can't you can't do any of the joyous things that you find joy in in your life the minute you decide to do that because you don't know when you're going to get a call that everything's crumbling please come yeah for sure yeah it's like you gain that respect I guess over the the years but uh this is the main thing right like as a your transition from employee to you know entrepreneur you now see entrepreneurship in New Light yeah what is the plan for the next one two years in your journey I think next one two years is to um I don't know yeah I think I hate this question because if you look at the last two years of my life um I could not have predicted any of it right like I don't even know what's going to happen one month later I'm living literally living uh I I I plan month at a time right now one month at a time 1 to two years from now there is no way for me to plan it because I know it's not going to happen I can tell you what I want what I want is to maybe creating a self- sustaining company which doesn't require me uh to create an awesome team which sort of independently comes up with new ideas and implements them and sort of you know creates a uh you know Revenue machine all by themselves Under the Umbrella of the organization that I've created and continue creating content because I love creating content I think that is one thing I know for sure that as long as people want to hear me talk because I know that I'm constantly learning and upskilling myself by talking to people reading books or whatever and I know that I'm able to decipher that in a way which the masses love and understand so I love that process so I want to continue doing that for as long as possible uh but in terms of an entrepreneurial journey I think just to refine the mission that I'm on which is spreading financial literacy and empower emping people to learn how to take control of their money because I think it all boils down to that uh you hear a lot of examples of unsuccessful entrepreneurs and the common threat that all of them have is they don't know how to manage their own money because they don't know how to manage their own money they're not able to survive in the business world because if you don't understand how money Works how cash flow Works how accounting works you cannot run a business you might have the greatest team the best technology and all of that if you don't understand how uh accounting Works how finances Works you're not going to be able to run a business you'll fail at it miserably because you'll place your Blind Faith on people who you hire and they're going to skim on the top it's going to happen so I think the first step for the country's empowerment is to learn how to manage their own money and that I think I'm at a very unique position to drive that and enable that so on the entrepreneurial front that is my singular Mission and bring as many smart people as possible people who are uh the smarter they are the more smarter than they are than me the better it is if I can bring all of such people onto a mission uh which incentivizes us all that is something that I I want to continue for the next two years I have a question so I recently hired this guy or rather we were going to hire him but then we didn't hire him content wrer and CV looked good looked like he had some good experience then we hired him and then a week later we realized he's not actually good at writing content right I mean we completely encourage people to use a chat gbd or a Bard but if you don't know what you're writing content about very clear right you you can't evaluate the outputs of AI so you're not able to do a good job of telling whether it's good output or bad output now he got caught so we spoke to him and we told him hey you you know you're not actually writing the scripts and then I asked him why don't you take like two three months he's a computer science guy so I said why don't you take 2 three months why don't you learn a little bit uh why don't you explore the space and he said no I need a job he was just done with college he's like no I can't take two three months off I really need a job and one thing I've learned over the years is that some people just get a job right out of college maybe because of financial constraints or whatever and then just get stuck there cuz by definition if you're taking an entry-level job it's already you're not exploring anything new and like you said you you won in content because you found an inflection point right short form you didn't look at anybody else you did something new in India yeah uh but that was also the result of a little bit of exploration after you were planning to go for MBA but you said I'll take some time off I'll explore and see if this thing works out so you had like an exploration phase do you think that exploration phase is was critical for you to be where you at how do you think young kids should look at an exploration phase is that even NE in a company or in their lives interesting question I think for me the exploration came because of more free time I think covid was the perfect environment for all of us to be all of all of us to be exploratory in in that time because it Fosters you see for most people um there are already a lot of preset options default options on what to do with your free time uh it could be catching up with your old friends going on watch for a movie Netflix clubbing concert so the capitalistic world has created so many entertainment opportunities for filling up all the free time that a person has Co removed a vast majority of that right so I strongly believe that what you do in your free time is the difference between being in the top 10% at something or being in the top .1% of something that is it but that is very hard to do after doing a 9 to7 job a lot of people are not going to have the bandwidth to do something productive with your free time now a lot of people assume this to be you know okay maybe work longer hours or maybe do something you know a side hustle or whatever so I think the hack over here is to do something which is fun if you can do something fun which is also productive that is the only way you can think of uh exploring something outside so the exploratory thing while it's important it is very difficult to find something which you're going to have fun uh while exploring it and it's not necessary that you always need to do something productive in your exploring time sometimes it can just be about adding another dimension to your character a lot of people in India are very boring if I may put it that way because they all have very similar lives you go to the office you come back home you watch TV you go to sleep right when was the last time you uh find somebody who is very very interested in let's say maybe an afficionado of an anime maybe he's very very uh knowledgeable about sneakers very very knowledgeable about cycle repair cycle repair whatever gardening you know basically one particular interest which adds another dimension to your personality because that will pay dividends in your professional life as well because at the end of the day what people don't realize to climb up the corporate ladder or to become more successful it's not just about your skill set because there's also the relationship angle right because at the end of the day the decision maker is a human being who is maybe at a position above you and if you have more Dimension to your character that person is going to pick you because you are a more likable person I want to have you around more in the higher positions of the company so either work on being more saying that you're saying that leadership at company weeds out generic people would I be can I compress it to that it doesn't weeds out but it significantly it it it doesn't even give you a foot in the door let's say you very smart at what you do you're very you know knowledable and all of that but if I don't even give you an opportunity because I already judged you because you're a boring guy you're not going to get a chance but if you have some dimension in your personality which is very unique I'm naturally gravitated towards you so even if you're medior at your work I'm still going to give you more attention at the end of the day it's attention right similar to let's say two T-Shirt Company one t-shirt company is maybe making you know 100% pure cotton but the other t-shirt company is 80% pure cotton but the 80% pure Cardon company has better marketing so I'm going to buy that than the other company's products similarly with human beings also you need to think of yourself as a marketing product if you focus more on yourself add more Dimensions to your personality you will sort of get more attention from the rest of the world because you get more attention doesn't matter if you have very high skill set or you know just enough good skill set you will still make it out there and what's the path like let's say I'm young I'm going to office 9 to5 should I like quit my job and take like a 3-month exploration period or should I just do it find a way to do it part time no that won't work nobody has that kind of luxury in India very few people um because I I'll tell you right um a lot of I I I've spoken to a couple of entrepreneurs in the past 3 weeks uh who uh not had the luxury of wealth you know came from lower middle class family and when I asked them I asked them the same question how do you start a business because if you start a business you're not going to make money in the beginning how are you going to pay for rent food electricity bill um there was only one answer both of them had the same answer do two jobs you work on your business but at the same time in your free time you they were both doing teaching gigs they were going to a training Education Institute they were teaching something for example one of the guys was good at math so he went to this training institute and was teaching math he was getting paid by the hour right and another person was teaching something for cat right this person had not appli you know had not had not cleared cat yet but then went on teaching cat right so they were hustling so hard so there is a way to do both exploratory with the business and make you know make money on the side to sustain yourself but like it's a it's a very hard path not many and also I think the narrative is working against it like Naran morti came out and said the 70 hours thing right yeah um it got a lot of lashback yeah right people kept came out and said why should I work 70 hours and this and that right but you know as much as I don't want to get myself in trouble I do think that it's important for you to like especially if you want to do something great in life you should be willing to put like 60 70 hours in it yeah I mean 100% but I I think uh to each to his own right not everybody wants to uh sort of not everybody's identity is their work I genuinely feel like uh a lot of the what do you say contentment as I would put it is driven by dopamin release now everybody has different triggers for dopamin release maybe for people like you and me is our identity is by our work what we do in our professional life is going to maybe drive societal respect and out of which we get our dopamin release and that's how we gain purpose out of life and contentment not everybody works that way for some people it could be their kids they don't care if they are you know just a midlevel manager at a company but their kids give them so much joy that they don't really care about working 70 hours a week for some people it could be their friends and Social Circle for some people it could just be like I'm not going to work 9 to 8 I'm going to work 9 to 5 and then I'm just going to you know plan you know you know a trip a weekend trip every but I think that's fine as long as you don't have expectations then of building a billion dollar Enterprise or whatever right you can't then you then you that's setting yourself up for like expectation disappointment true so what happens is because we are in such a connected world today you are seeing every what is everybody up to that is not the case 30 40 years back now even if you are leading it's the it's the grass is greener on the other side narrative right let's say for example I'm already happy I have you know beautiful kids I have you know great friend Circle I'm going on vacations now because I'm seeing this billionaire let's say you are the billionaire I'm going to see that your life is better than mine but you never got to see the beauty beauty of my life about my kids and my friends and all of that because what I'm seeing is the tangible factor which is your net worth so I'm going to assume that okay your life is better than mine I'm going to resent you I'm going to start hating you I'm going to whenever you tweet on Twitter I'm going to trolling you right so I think this connected world that we are living in today because of you know meta and Google has sort of increased the anxiety and lowered the you know happiness index of the world because you just have so much more expectations in life and you've been getting some of that this thing no because you've got to scale and seb's really come after you and yeah I don't think se's really come after you but I think the definitely the media has come after you yeah I think you know you made a nice video about this where you said that actually there are two kinds of influencers one is the stock tips people and then there's you who's disseminating personal finance information yeah but every media article I saw had your face on it when sebie cracked down yeah how do you feel about that yeah I mean actually it's a very big misconception it's more of a PR problem and I've spoken to a couple of people from sebi and they are all for for the kind of content that I'm making right because it is not um you know direct uh advice what I mean by direct advice is saying by this which directly influences um your money in a particular company right see sebbi has perview over Equity markets now if I'm taking the name of a company and asking you to invest Now by virtue of my distribution I can influence the price of that stock make it go up right and then you will see that you made profits and then I will exit my money because I've made the profits and you are making the loss this is called a pump and dump SK this is called a pump and dump scheme and this is what sebi is uh pro has a problem with I don't do all of this stuff because this is not my cup of tea I'm not going to take responsibility for your money on such a myopic level where I tell you to buy this particular stock and if that stock drops 30% 10,000 people lose money because of me I cannot live with that right so I think that is the first misconception that people have bucketed all of us influencers into one category um and the bigger problem like you said is the media because the media is the one which is uh pumping information to the country and uh people year ago they were your friends they were my friends I would see you everywhere on all the media yeah so media is like that media is not your friend right they your that's what I that's what we thought media is our friend but they were again using you because they were getting their traffic into their website like we need to understand how a media company Works people think that you know your media companies like mint and economic Times are these you know holy temples of information where they're coming up with unbiased information to educate and keep the country you know financially aware but that's not how media Works media Works based on how much traffic they can build on their website so that they can put ads of companies and make money out of it so during the covid boom because people like me were getting all the distribution it made sense for them to write articles about me because they knew that the eyeballs from here would come to their website due to which their ads Revenue will increase that's why they came to me I thought they were my friends because you know they thought okay I'm doing something good for the country so they wanted to talk about it but that's not the hidden agenda hidden agenda was they make more money from me today what has happened is because the narrative from beginning was Sharon is a influencer this that and now when the real miscreant which I mean the troublemakers uh started coming and doing this pump and dumb scheme they were also called influencer right and then the sebbi comes in now for the media the hot story is not Sharon is you know U uh helping with the financial literacy of the country now the hot story sebi is after influencers now who are the influencers which were causing problems the stock tip and the pump and dump scheme guys but what was the narrative from the beginning Sharon is also a influencer they failed to make two separate names because they knew that if Sharon is also part of the influencer ecosystem the views will still come to their website due to which that ad Revenue will still be there right so that is what happened and that is what is continuing to happen but yeah I mean that's that's life right uh we think the world is a fair place but the end of the day we are all fending for ourselves and if that's what the media has to do let them do it I mean we've been me and some other content creators have been fighting against him have they've been quiet for the last 6 months because uh people saw the hypocrisy what mean by the hypocrisy is Media was criticizing influencers for promoting crypto and then one month later they're promoting cryptocurrencies all right and when you ask them what is this about what is this hypocrisy they're like hey they have this separate page called the ad space which is sort of like this wall where anybody can kind of come put money and promote whatever they want so by that logic are you telling me like if you want to promote band stuff in India you you're telling me that you can come on an economic Times or a mints website because it's like like a free wall you can just put any flyer you want and that's the justification that they're giving to the public I think that's absolute hypocrisy right there's one piece where I do agree with them about this right which is that it is true that anyone can come like it's sort of a coin operated system you come there and you can put up an ad with you it's coming from your mouth yeah you are sort of saying that I think this is good whereas the media kind of has like distance from it by saying that okay this is the article this is the ad yeah but you feel that's not I think that is again a great area I feel I mean look at let's look at from the customer lens for get the law for law I know you're right because that's the reason why they're doing it right if they were actually law wrong as per the law they would have you know the government would come after them or the court would come after them but let's look at it from the customer lens right if you ask any average Jo today in India if you see an ad of promoting cryptocurrencies on economic Times page or on Hindustan times page do you are you going to be uh less influenced because it says promoted on the top are you not going to give it more importance because it says Economic Times on the top from a customer lens there's no difference right I'm still going to give it the higher importance because Economic Times is a century old brand which has been you know which is a legacy in this country they trust it more than you yeah they trust it more than me so even if you're telling me that by according to the law they are fine because they're clearly mentioning it's an ad I mean even I mention it's an ad right if I'm saying if I'm going to promote cryptocurrency they're going to say it's it's an ad so similarly if the media is going to say an ad does it make them less uh complicit I mean I I don't I don't think so I think that's hypocrisy because at the end of the day the damage is still happening no the pump and dump schemes like for example when uh these newspapers are promoting cryptocurrencies uh eight of those cryptocurrencies where victims are pump and dumb schemes right now you're telling me that if the audience or the readers of those newspapers fell prey for that you're saying the newspaper is not to blame for that just because they put the word ad but the influencer is but but all the finance influen what banded together to kind of take this on what what's the plan no I think now it's over I mean it's not Hot Topic anymore right now we're just waiting for the sebi to come up with its uh you know official statements but you're getting a license anyway yeah yeah we are getting a license anyway but I think even if you do not get a license the consultation paper that sebi came up with I think they have made a mountain out of a mole hill I don't mean the sebi I mean the media right the interpretation of the se's consultation paper is that you cannot promote Direct stocks or in exchange for money direct stocks or direct mutual funds in exchange for money which most of us don't even do right so even if it comes into fruition it makes zero [ __ ] in our life last question Sharon you've been a content creator for so long you took advantage of an inflection point which is short form content covid etc etc and you made it is there still space being a finance content creator I know that the tech is there like I can just use this phone it's got dual view I can basically shoot myself shoot a reel get it packaged get it out very quickly yeah in your case uh do you think there's new content formats in finance that are untapped what's a new Creator to do if they want to be a personal finance Creator I think it's kind of saturated if you ask me because at least in this year which is 2023 because of the whole issue with the the pr angle of influencers right uh the media has already made it out that you know um talking about these influencers don't trust them and all of that so I think there's not really an opportunity for new Finance content creators to come up and create a career out of it because they're already going to get the hit from day one seeing the media is preventing new creators I think the damage is already done at least for the next couple of years I think until once sebie comes out with a new thing maybe let's say SE comes up with clear guidelines on how to be a finance content creator that's the part I don't like I mean the media has some some good points but I think the part that I don't like is we discourage new people to come out and disseminate Finance content by just bucketing everyone together yeah I think what you and all the other Finance creators have done for India which is just improve awareness like I didn't invest till I was 26 and then I saw all these content creators saying you have to invest otherwise whatever I think bring all the money in your house yeah yeah I'm doing literally the opposite of what you told me in this video but in general I think everyone's like uh more people have become financially disciplined because of what you guys have done and I think that's a good thing right and I don't like that we're discouraging the next wave of people from doing that just because no I think the damage is been done at least for the next 2 years uh but maybe maybe let's say one one and a half year from now I think people's perception also is very very malleable I would say uh in the in the world of social media I think perception will change and then there will be I mean let's say the current Finance content creators will sort of go out of fashion which will definitely happen like unless they have built a business around it they they' become a financial entrepreneur uh by use leveraging the distribution I think the current Finance content creators as we see them today will not be around after 3 4 years they will get irrelevant I am 100% sure about that um and that's true of any content creator forget Finance content creator any content creator has a shelf life of three or four years unless they have really cracked uh long form content for topical news meaning any trending new new topic is coming you're making a video about Media Company being a media company you're being a reporter you are a news reporter unless you are that I think the shelf life for I mean that's why I pivoted as well right because that's the most highest longevity kind of content you could do correct so I think the shelf life of most content creators whether you're a finance or anything is three or four years so then there they have to be replaced no someone needs to come there's still a need uh for financial literacy there's still a need for learning how to invest your money so the new age uh and the next wave of Finance content creators will come and how just the way I had to you know combine entertainment with Finance they might be come up with something entirely new and entirely different which we can't even think of right and then that will be the new wave of Finance but your recommendation is if you're a young Finance Creator don't get into it right now don't get it into it right now there's no point there's like I mean you could do it but I don't see us it's saturated plus the sentiment Is Not Great correct it's saturated but the sentiment is not it's already workr it right now and the sentiment is also not good so the both the macro and the micro view is not good interesting interesting Sean thank you so much for being here I learned a lot yeah and uh I'm glad that you know you were able to explain all your sentences like you're able to use 30 sentences to explain something because I think there's a lot of like bad clipping going on on the internet there's

support all the entrepreneur and stories and he was like you know because I was like this like you have to like there's no option not to hey everybody Welcome to yet another episode of OnePlus open conversations today we're going to be talking to sh Sharma shda has been an inspiration of mine because she's been in media for such a long time especially in startup media one of the first known startup media companies in India that covered startups it was the first place I was ever covered and therefore it's very special to my heart but today is going to be a Media Master Class you are going to learn everything from how do you build a media company how much money do you need exactly to the rupee to the last rupee how much money you need how much money can sponsors pay you how do you monetize media whether it's directly through ads or events or subscriptions which are the right ways which are the wrong ways plus we're also going to learn about predictions for the future media's thoughts on content creators and all of that wonderful stuff all in today's episode so stay tuned till the very ending because this this is an episode I wouldn't miss so you shouldn't [Music] either sh I want start off with a very simple simple question how did you get here like what's your story so far like what's your story what is my story you know honestly I keep thinking about what is my story and uh and maybe I'm not generalizing it but my story is the story of a very middle class India I've talked about a lot that I grew up in Bihar um in a time when it was politically very very uh uh non-stable not safe uh and I grew up in a family of four daughters so somewhere that really shaped me I had to work hard I had to prove that uh you know at that time Dar if you were born as a girl child then Dari is like the like people think oh my God liability and I was told that when I was born then everyone in my family cried my distant relatives so somewhere that sense was there that I have to do something and I don't have to be a liability so maybe my story like it's like you know the ghost behind me has been that liability n independent and somewhere you know and I say biar because when you're a bihari you talk in a certain way in Hindi many so there's a sing song way a bihari way which I'm sure many of your viewers would understand what I'm saying so I was always ridiculed also about that and all these things shaped me in the way that one started your story somewhere for me it was very important that where you come from who you are family should not determine the story cuz we are all special and uh I think if I was treated very specially then this would not have happened and and and and that shaped uh I feel that's primarily my story do you feel that can be generalized that today um I mean I noticed this a lot right and I'm afraid to say it in public but I'll say it anyway um do you feel like a little bit of that Strife in your early years a little bit of that struggle is important for Success because I see a lot of people who are coddled today by their parents and all right like we are a little bit the next generation is a little bit spoiled do you feel like at least from your perspective struggle was necessary to get to where you were absolutely Mar you know maybe it's my bias but I have a huge uh uh enchantment with pain in life you have to experience pain you have to experience disappointment rejection humiliation uh all those things are the best sounds cliche but they are actually the best teachers because if you're treated very nicely I don't I don't know how will you grow because if you look at this whole uh you know butterfly or whatever anything remarkable there has to be pain and if there's no pain then how are you I get attracted to people who have struggled uh and who have come up on their own and that's why startups I love startups yeah is that the was that the original story behind your story like how did that happen like I know you were at CNBC for a while how did that how did the CNBC thing happen like I told you that bihari never left me and I went to media and somewhere I thought in media uh people celebrate success all of us celebrate success and we all want to learn from success watch success to Lifestyle of the Rich and Famous and all those things you know there's an aspirational value we are an aspirational country but somewhere I just you know and I used to really meet a lot of people and they all had a story and one day I remember very clearly and on preneur called me very successful big name uh but not relatively big name in the scheme of things for a prime time uh and he told me and you know like he called me and he said oh who do you think you are you're in CNBC and this and that and was slota he had an IPO and a bigger IPO had happened and and and he had tears and to me that was a very very big surprise because he's one of the most confident people you'll meet him and you'll be like wow like and I don't want to name him and for him his story was so personal his Venture was so personal it was his journey and that made me realize that for everyone for all of us our story is so important and we need that voice we need to tell our stories and and somewhere uh you know I started going to I Bombay I used to meet people young people I always you know I think that if you have to be relevant then you need to keep talking to to very very young people and and and startups was a word that I heard in 2008 and uh they wanted to tell their stories and uh when I asked that let's do these stories at scale that time it couldn't happen so I started your story so um CNBC to your story you've told us that it was this one you know story that really triggered it but what's a big shift in your story going from like a small company from just somebody writing stories about like from a Blog to the Juggernaut that it became when I became 20 years old right what was a big shift for you thank you for saying that and I think and I think I don't why I felt it was Juggernaut right because every story I'd consume about startups everything that I was learning everything about zomato this that it felt like you were you w't settling right you were like in this never settled attitude where you like I want to cover every single founder uh every single new founder who's raised money and I was like that is something I can learn from so I want to know if from your perspective what is the shift how did you go from like just a Blog to now relevant no thank you Von uh you're being kind like in my mind I think that we are very very very small and we've done one and a half lakh stories so far that's not small but I just think that there like if you ask me in my mind and I can tell you since 15 years if you'll see me 15 years back I spoke the same thing I'm I have spoken the same thing for 15 years that India is a country of over a billion people and stories need to be told and in my mind everyone told me it's a Blog it will not work don't do it it's an NGO uh you shouldn't do it and somewhere the more I heard no no no no this shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't some of the VCS I knew that time because I was working in CNBC and I called you could do it in WordPress and blogger write it over there it's your fancy it's your hobby do it because this is not going to work this is uh and and you'll get bored and and there's no story here and startups what is that and see I'm talking about 2008 this uh is long long time back because today people will say okay what but 2008 was a very different context and the more I heard that this is an NGO this will not work so somewhere for me it was not a media company or anything it was like somewhere my pain or my need for validation and being sexy these stories will not work why and someone had told me this is BNI category and I was like what is BNI so B ad everything so maybe I wouldn't and in my mind it was always very big it a delusional I always think like you know today also if you ask me I just think that I wish I had a lot of money because your story should be in every town Village and City to tell everyone's story because it's not like you know we all feel good no like we all need that encouragement I don't see it as media I see it as an encouraging platform it should just encourage everyone who's trying to do something so yeah somewhere having so if I had to tell people who are in unsexy uncool non-scalable NGO sort of category is that it's all in the mind like you have to think it's big and you and you think your big shift was the fact that you thought it was very big but the reality of what people were telling you was very different so it became about I've got to prove everybody wrong and therefore that started resulting in you putting effort into your story and that growing do you feel that you would you can attribute cuz I'm trying to find I know life is a series of you know a lot of random things right I'm trying to find one instance that really powered you through there are two three very simple things V that kept me going I remember I had written about an entrepreneur who was an army guy and he left and he had started something and he cried like you know that like this means so much to me and for me every day imagine what I was doing writing 5 10 stories of entrepreneurs of people doing something validation every day if you're getting that kind of a high then that is a big thing mean from the fact that the your supporters even though the minority at that point was just vocal about it absolutely absolutely and the second thing was I think somewhere my business uh context because I was working before and it I didn't jump into it was that I remember first Sun Micro Systems used to be there which got sold to Oracle and I remember this very clearly 2008 end bakish used to be there and they said oh we need startups in our program and that gave me that I still remember the deal he said 25,000 rupees I said no give me and if you can get me 100 start and I said I'll get you 200 you give me a lakh rupees and uh enrolled for the program because it was a free program then I thought somewhere PES sh it was it has been just experiment experiment based on that stories have to be told but yeah big moment if you ask me getting investment like unfortunately investment yes along with how did that happen I know ran at that point was not a fan of media oh yeah yeah in fact he told me that media and I don't get so how do you get the meeting withan if I'm a young girl let's say 21 years old I want to get into media uh and I need to raise money right and I want to meet somebody like ratan Tata what do I need to have like what what how many views do I need to have how do I get an intro with him you know this is the question which I think you should cut this into a module because I have got thousands of people reaching out to say can you connect me to Mr Tata this video is an MBA master class on making you know Media Company how did you raise money from rata you know so step by step very simple so I had got money just got money from kalari Capital vanani colola so she had all her companies present uh to Mr Tata and uh I remember I still remember it was 2015 and he had flown himself from Mumbai and come to Bangalore and I know that he and you know I was seeing that companies were presenting they all had slides and decks and you know Market sizing and all those words which are very very important right time and it was proper presentation and I noticed that while he was listening to everyone he was dozing off because he was tired and and and and uh and he's old so then I asked that Mr Tata would you like a cup of tea or coffee and he said yes please and then but but I knew also that my time I was not you know your story number one company all the important more funded companies were presenting I was last in the line and I didn't even have a presentation to be honest then it was like okay the meeting is over but Von a night before that I had not slept and you know the law of attraction secret book I had said Mr Tata has invested in my company and I swear I'm going on record to say whole night I said excitement Mr Tata has invested in my company I swear on God I did that and I was like oh my meeting is not going to happen not and I was like no still in that crazy moment it is going to happen it is so then when I had given T and said oh she sh she runs your story then he asked me out of politeness or whatever so I said Mr Tata you have to give me one minute because it was ending the meeting and my meeting was not happening so I said Mr Tata you have said this that it still hurts me and you've gone on record to say this that it still hurts me that in this country where you come from or what you you know where you are from still determines how far you can go right like if you're from a rich family or whatever and I want an equal India where everyone has an equal opportunity and I said Mr Tata have lived that for the last 8 years every single day where every story should be important and you have to support me invest and support all the entrepreneurs and stories and he was like you know because I was like this like you have to like there's no option not to then he smiled and then he was like then he said um so he said media and I don't get along I said Mr Tata you and I will get along because the vision is this and he started laughing and then I heard from his team that uh yeah he'll put in money and and somewhere that's what I'm saying that you know somewhere the honesty confidence and just the Purity you know you can't like sorry to say the word but you can't your way into doing these kind of things you have to have and I was like thinking that day I said okay the Law of Attraction really really works you know I got a call like after a few days hello shadha where are you I said you know my sister is driving I was in Mumbai that time for a meeting I'm on the road so he said okay are you ready to hear a news and I said yes tell me then he said oh Mr Tata really liked you and he wants to invest in your story and I was like oh I told my sister like stop the car stop the car and uh and it was very I said listen very very thankful and I think also the purpose maybe he related also to the purpose to to support and I remember that day I was so emotional I called my father because I hadn't spoken to him after my mother's death for many many years and I told him Papa uh you know that's the joke all of you should hear is that I called him and this was very emotional I thought this is a moment for me to call because I called him and I said uh Papa Mr Tata ran Tata is investing in your story then he says hm and then of course that's the sign of validation from Indian Dad yeah yeah H but again the Indian dad he says H but what's the big deal he has invested I read in the newspaper he's investing in every company he's invested in this this this okay but then he said okay good but you know so to answer your question it's sometimes not sometimes I think mostly it is preparation everyday doing the same work manifesting I believe getting lucky in between like five people would have said no oh listen everyone said no yeah but I also have to call out I have more investors I have aniola Kari Capital she's been phenomenal um uh uh 314 qualcom Ventures and you see B endowment fund which is r&t and UC Berkeley had tied up so Mr Tata uh you know the fund the collaboration also invested uh in the company but shha if you were starting like a media company today right now everything's changed when you started I think we had maybe a handful of media companies serious ones today it seems like you know everyone has a YouTube channel everyone has this it feels like it's it feels like a crazy world now if you were giving advice to an 18 19 year old to start a media company today because this podcast by the way everything that I'm doing here is about the future it's like I Tred to do one or two questions about the past and I'm like okay if you were to rebuild it but 2024 and Beyond how would that look how would that work so I'd love to know from you what would you do differently today like AI is there it seems a little bit scary I know you have you know your perspective on journalism has changed over the last decade fire away first I would tell an 18 19 year old think 10 times before starting a media company uh because Media company is all businesses starting up anything is very hard in India it becomes doubly hard uh but media company because for India because you know if you're starting today and I think in last 15 years relatively it is becoming better and better because if you look at people who've created categories companies that have created categories in this space they you need money we don't come from a social security background and while we hear oh uh you know there's ample of capital for good entrepreneurs and all that I think mostly entrepreneur much money though if you're starting a media company today what's the minimum amount of capital you would raise I would say that today because it's not media but it's also the distribution and today it's increasingly hard when I started in 2008 there was I listen if there was anyone who was covering startup in 2008 startup as a word if you searched on Google was not there when it came to Indian media at all so then for me it was a very that audience that Target that Community was very distinct you found something that nobody else was tackling and you said this is a gap yes and you went after but let's say I found a gap today I'm talking about let's say an 18 19y old kid found a gap today but Von today I just also want to call out finding a gap today increasingly is much harder like them new territory finding is much harder like you know I know everyone is a YouTuber today everyone is a podcaster today everyone is covering every possible category it's imploded in a way so that's why to build a brand and to stand out in the crowd you will need consistency to do a shoot you will need consistency people demand a certain sort of a view production quality the experience which an audience today expects or a viewer expects is also different so give me a specific number 50 lakhs 75 lakhs a CR just do some rough math see I'm a very bootstrap mentality person so I would say at least you have Z you'll be able to learn something and you think I mean obviously people who come from wealthy backgrounds that should not be hard to raise from friends and family but otherwise if you come from a tier 2 tier three background this would be something You' raise venture capital for or Angel investment for Angel investment and what kind of Angel Investors would you look for I would say people who been in this space people who understand from Media or ancillary because today media also what do we mean by media media could mean today even a gaming company anyone who has a distribution right anyone who has some sort of a content today I would say so many VCS are today Media company name a category everyone is a media company and I think media has become like like I I don't know a category where media is not a play today and if you don't build a media arm you die yeah you you have to you have to be talking you have to you know there's so much of cacophony of everyone talking something or the other you have to stand out so today breaking from that noise and establishing yourself is much harder than it was 15 years back got it so let me let me summarize a step so far find a gap raise 50 lakhs to a CR what's the next step who do you hire one of course if you can find co-founders who believe and who can come with no cost uh on Equity then get them how do you find them in media especially do you go to journalist who've been who who you think can graduate to co-founder level or do you find people completely outside of Journalism I think you know that question I would say would be second question the first question would be of someone who's interested because to me you know imaginative people who with execution skills and they could be across today see people who are doing some great content and distribution are not necessarily they like they would be Finance professionals like and and today we living in that world you could could be a great chef you could be a great skin doctor with a very nice Beauty distribution or a beauty these things so find someone who is interested in the space and the sort of media that you're creating someone who comes but I'm of course saying that there is an advantage to having certain sort of experience and understanding of the space that you're entering in because this is such a fluid space today like media like I every day think about media like because it's getting so dis intermediated right like earlier when I grew up I had NDTV right like English TV you read Times of India the print and TV by far were the definition of media and there were certain anchors and then there were certain reporters whom you read and you you know watched and that it was one way of distribution like w or limited distribution date if I am today interested in finance content or any you know stock market I can search and there might be some YouTuber who will give me far better input than a media company right so that to me is an interesting thing and that's why to start in the space would require a lot of thinking in terms of Target care audience content distribution expertise what you bringing to it and today more often they're not relationship and Network all those things become very very important if you're starting a media company okay let's say you found a co-founder let's say you found your best friend like this girl 20 years old sitting you know in aabad has found a co-founder and they found a gap and they've raised 50 lakhs to a CR what's the next step then you have to produce the content and the biggest thing I would say the the only to me and again it's my bias the only and the biggest thing you require in this business is stamina right like stamina is very important and consistency so you have to like for me when I started your story I used to write every day write yeah 2008 9 10 how how how much would you write like five 10 stories a day you write five stories a day I'm not a writer neither AI or generative Ai and we should talk about that is how that is disrupting for me it was like meet someone I love you I like you I see your honesty because it's about encouragement right so 510 and and I wouldn't sleep right every day and I had someone in jabalpur who used to I used to give him 3,000 to begin with and he used to upload it and I remember the site used to be jumla software but every day Sunday Saturday Sunday consistency so brand every day you have to do that so so I would say that if you find someone and then start having that stamina to start writing every day because it takes time to you know there's this amazing analogy I believe in that it takes uh drop drop drop to One Day become an ocean the last piece of this how do you make money of this how are you monetizing what are your unit economics and what should these people learn from it you know I also think about it me say it's it's a it's the toughest toughest Journey you know sometimes I think that the VCS and the people and the experts who had told me that you should have done an NGO then I should have listened to them because it is tough to make money in Media monetizing let's be clear as of now I think media businesses across not just in India across the world and more so in India because of the pricing and everything is very very hard very tough and that's why somewhere you have to build the hustle Mo thing of how do you innovate on the revenue so there are two three things which your story did and I think I feel proud about that because we run a profitable company we've run like eight years I bootstrapped and it was profitable and yes when I raised money for a couple of years it was not again it was profitable but last year I have to say we not profitable hopefully this year again we will be so is that we said that to me every user we started positioning our audience very differently and these are entrepreneurs these are business owners these are people who grow and then we started talking to only people who would be interested in talking to this community how would you talk to them would you email them first would you meet them at events I would meet them at events like like you know big host and just find where they are and be where they are in fact uh uh and then those are things that we don't talk these are very practical things you have to go meet and sell yourself because they're not going to be coming to you emails they will get a lot and they'll not be responding to you so you have to tap into your network and start meeting them so initially one meets them then you have to deliver you have to perform and then they start giving you more money but I would say we more of a B2B when it comes to the revenue part of it is that uh it was you know doing certain sort of an understanding I remember one company was coming entering India in the cloud space then how many Cloud how many startups are using Cloud what is their spent giving that kind of a research doing round taes doing uh you know research papers doing branded content series on or educational series on certain topics so that's where we started initially making money then of course events Tex Parks now it's 14 years very early on Tex Parks became a property uh where people were coming because I think I would still say like I feel proud about Tex Parks because wonderful events like actually I feel of all the media events in India textbox is the best I also can say that I will I'm very critical vun about everything that we do but I just think that text park somewhere is good yeah I'm telling you as an audience member unated that is pretty good right but today I know I'm sure the sponsors pay a lot of money but let's say when you did the first text Parks which was so many years ago I still remember it very clearly it was in 2010 and uh the money we made was uh 5 lakh rupees interesting from your title sponsor yeah Microsoft was the sponsor and Kanan Partners a VC fund was SP sponsored and Mumbai Angels had given a little bit of money so I clearly remember all three of them and how does it happen you you how many meetings does it take for you to get five laks from them so Kanan Partners I had a friend so I pushed him and asked him and and of of course uh so that's what you have to hustle your way Microsoft uh I still remember the person there was Girish josi uh I had to do a lot of uh meetings uh but they were they used to run a program called Microsoft bits Park and they wanted to uh you know get on board a lot of startups so it was very very targeted and relevant for them so they also supported it interesting and what do you think about subscriptions i' I've been seeing a lot of media companies go sub the subscription route now and I've seen large media companies really bet the company on it I'm not a big believer personally right because I mean I've seen some of I I do know there is some evidence in favor I know in the US there's some companies that are doing subscription well some media companies in India though I just feel like my behavior is like I don't pay for subscriptions too much even if it's good quality content but I'd love to know your thoughts on it you know we don't pay for software what we were discussing we don't like to pay we'll pay for a movie maybe to go to a cinema Hall we'll pay for one time is fine yeah we'll pay for a rock concert show or we'll pay for we do pay we have the paying power but we don't pay for content and especially if it is not you know if especially if it is content like we do in your story which is not Sensational we have over anchored on positive standing with people people who want to have a question there so you're saying overtly Sensational content drives subscription listen I have a very strong view that nothing drives subscription like but maybe maybe you would have a certain set of audience who will be intelligent uh people with a certain worldview so maybe you'll find your tribe so maybe there will be a certain at scale subscription in India still has to be proven we have okay I also have to say this on record we have a subscription uh platform called cap table uh where we have some very fantastic journalists they write content one story a day uh and we have but that's a part of the overall if I start betting on it uh then that would not be it because I somehow personally if you ask me I'm not a fan of subscription I feel good content should be available and there should be people who uh subsidize for it or pay for it you think in a decade this might change in a targeted way yes for example if I am very very interested in learning about for example I'm very interested in learning about valuations or uh fundraising or certain you know or something something about fintech or something about you know it could be any subject then having some very specialized content and paying like substack right in us where people started newsletters and and and they had subscribers now I don't know how much it has scaled or not scale but audience was paying for it and generally we look at us for all these things so I think in India maybe for certain sort of content they would be a certain set of people who pay but if you're thinking of a very scalable you're thinking like 100 million no one's yoube subscribe to YouTube premium we are all hooked on to YouTube but I wonder what's the number yeah so I I want to show you something okay this is a very interesting piece of content it steps up to what you just told me let me just open this I did a reel recently I've I've been doing lots of reels like this Disney just unve this robot that's got an actual personality unlike what Boston Dynamics or Tesla produces this one seems like people are more likely to interact with it sort of like people think none of that is real it's all generated of AI so we've managed to find tut the model to do text uh that it's sort of right side me it's not perfect yet we've got we use a tool called hen to do the video and audio we have our own stack to kind of you know clone our audio I feel we're getting to the point where generative AI can be used to write a bunch of content especially the less investiga journalism you need to do to get a piece of content the more likely it is to be disrupted by AI I know that you're doing some gen stuff I love to know what it is and and how you think the future because this is all about the future this podcast especially right how's it going to play out in your opinion you know one is that one has to be very open because I just think that this space is only going to keep getting disrupted it has I would say with the creators with the YouTube with the podcast with the internet you know so last two three years and and with covid like just see how the space is getting disrupted the media space is getting disrupted so many media companies large media companies are now uh also struggling right so so one that it is going to get disrupted second is that I think generative AI the biggest disruption in any space with AI would be in media space in content space and of course uh with this kind of a content if you're doing something informational uh or something which is like you know where I can learn or pick or uh do then there I think there'll be a lot of influence uh of uh uh this we also in your story we call it nucleus AI we writing a lot of stories like a lot of stories you have your own AI intern yes yes we have a team in fact very smart people from I Madras who are working experimenting and doing some cool stuff because we also you know as you said one has to be uh relevant and uh so uh one is working on that we're having said all that I still feel that there is going to be in the new world the good thing isot Cinemas better overall so now even in a theater you start getting good movies with the regional Cinemas coming with the disruption that has happened with OTS in some way I have to give credit that a lot of people and I love Manoj vajpai people like that got a voice they became more Superstar than we you know what we saw of these people preot world so that disruption happened because of the platform so the quality and the content became better I think with generative AI of course there'll be a lot of disruption a lot of mundane Works press release writing informational content I also think that it's also going to be a great world because it will also lead to creative brains and uh to human imaginations to do different kinds of content and I think that imagination realm realm of that I still feel AI is what you feed into it and and they give that right so it's machine learning the whatever you're feeding uh them but the creative part of it uh what you how you interact how you think of the narrative yes that I think will get very specialized and I hope we will all be pushed to do a better job to create better content to think of better stories how should a journalist think about this you know that's a very interesting question I I feel that the way we grew up with journalists and the way we have journalism and the world now I think it's changing a lot because like like I don't know the definition of journalist is also changing right like who is a journalist I'm talking about somebody who's been through there are schools for this right I've been through journalism School I've done this for a few years I've got a set process I follow the process to the te and now I see these bunch of YouTubers going out and you know just saying whatever they want that's the world so you have to adapt and you have to adjust and you have to live this world and you have to plan for this world and you have to prepare yourself for this world yeah and what do they think about AI like in the sense if AI is there and it's writing the simple stories do you feel journalism should move more towards investigative journalism cuz digging out information is not something AI can do yet I think you I think AI is a great uh tool for journalists because now you can research and put some uh search and you can get all sort of information you know your research time reduces so that also gives you time to imagine to think to reflect and to come up with stories which are very incisive so not necessarily investigative it could also be very very you know New Perspective new insight something that I have not heard something that makes me think and to do that someone has to be thinking like you know some of the things which have remained Eternal it's like that McDonald's narrative right McDonald's is not a food company it's a real estate company that was like that's a perspective shift and I know lots of Indian companies where when you talk to the founders like you're thinking about my company this way because the media has told you this but actually I'm thinking about my company this way and for me those are very insightful I feel like journalism move to that move to that but that requires you speaking to the founders yes and you know the other thing I also feel is that like for my company myself I just never thought of your story as a media company in fact to be honest with you vun I always thought that the labeling was very siloing your story to Media because how do you say that we are a media company I always thought that you know I wanted to create a new word and hopefully one day I will is that it's a community platform if you you know like to me if I had to look at my last 15 years of Journey I said we've been played a very crucial role in ecosystem building like we started talking about startups in 2008 9 10 11 12 blah you know it imploded after 12 13 14 or whatever 15 16 whatever so how but it was more about talking about people and that was it a media play or was it an ecosystem play or was it an ecosystem platform Community play right so so the definition also of media the definition of L and if you make a lot of the money from events then technically media is just one of the things you do you saw one shift okay you saw the shift of audience behavior from desktops because I remember when that story came out about us I was using it on the desktop me too then it moved to mobile phones then you probably saw a little bit of tablets in and now you have these you know foldables that are all over the place so and for me personally it's like 7 is 5 ratio I like reading from this and now you have VR AR like newer platforms it feels like audience Behavior has changed formats is one thing and I'm sure you're adapting how uh over time with to those formats but what are other audience shifts you've seen like what is something that you know for sure audience Behavior has changed over the last decade in this and it's like you're definitive about you know many things uh with due humility attention span has completely gone like today like everyone's everyone who grew up with this desktop era move to the mobile era yeah in the desktop era we had more attention yeah of course you could read a story or you could like you know like at least you know I have a theory around this it's a wild Theory it could be wrong but I'll tell you anyway I think the amount of attention you can pay to something is directly proportional to the screen size it's weird I have a very very large monitor I have multiple monitors at home so the largest one if I'm reading something or I'm watching something I pay far more attention if I'm on this just because the screen size is much larger I pay more attention I had a small phone before this okay really tiny phone before this and there I only just watch shorts so I understand platforms are also changing like a YouTube is also saying I'll do short video and all that but I feel it's somewhere to do with the realistate I never thought about it but it could be that today I just think that you know to answer your question in terms of media and content creation today I see all the investors as content creators I see entrepreneurs as Founders as content creators I see media companies as content creator so who is not creating content and when you have so many people talking about for example fundraising everyone is talking about fundraising how to stay motivated everyone is talking about how to stay motivated then you keep on say then you need motivation by not watching sometimes any of this so see Supply demand change is causing audience attention spans to reduce that's a definitive Behavior change you've seen so does that reflect in the stories you right and yes and it also should reflect and must must reflect in terms of you know again this is which it will require a lot of thinking and creativities in terms of a minute may do minute May minute May how do you deliver like you know you were also talking about this right just before this is that now in that short attention span how do you hook the audience how do you get them to listen to you how do you get them to be loyal to you because you know going back to the earlier question if to 20 18 year old is starting a media company today starting a media company getting audience is right maybe with that 50 lakh one two crores you'll be able to do that but then to get them to be hooked on to you to be able to get them to come to you every day or maybe every week or every hour or whatever that is where a lot of uh you know a lot of thinking will be required because that behavior has changed any other shift you see Facebook LinkedIn is where now I think so saying you can't be loyal to any platforms it's increasingly becoming hard to be loyal to any uh platforms I would say if you're asking about audience second I would say that the audience has become extremely more vocal and demanding they will tell you what they like and don't like they don't like so they're not going to be submissive or they're not going to just passively consume you they're very actively consuming and they have very active Loop of giving feedback do you feel that with companies at least a media company like yours when the audience says something bad it affects you oh my God met to everyone used to tell me oh my God like oh she's so emotional oh she's not she's so sensitive oh she's not a good leader oh she's very U emotional because I would cry at the drop of the Hat I would get so Disturbed I wouldn't sleep and you know it's not just Media company I think everyone goes through this process and you have to go through this process again coming back to pain like sometimes you feel oh my God it's so unfair like you know I always thought that uh you know there's a Hindi song and you wouldn't have heard all your audience wouldn't have heard there's a very nice song saying I was like thinking that you know you're loving all the entrepreneurs telling everyone's story everyone will be like so happy and encouraging and supporting but there was so much of negative criticism that oh this is a PR platform this is a mouthpiece this is like a paid platform this is this oh she's dumb they don't understand they don't know the right journalism they're not critical so sometimes just being encouraging in this country has been the hardest hardest job because if you are encouraging your positive then you are dumb if you're critical you are negative or you're P I see that in the comments all the all the time there'll be one person in the comments who's just critical because he's like I'll get likes of this I'll get views of this but I'll tell you one thing I think with startups it doesn't take a genius to say this is going to fail it's obvious right like you raised 5 million 99% of the time you're going to fail the stats say this person is going to fail by definition they're trying something insane so when a media company says look these guys failed I called it a year ago that to me is is the easy thing to do I feel yeah it sounds smart right for you to poke holes in something that that exists because just is it's like there'll be 10 people trying to do something and obviously it's going to fail I feel encouraging them is harder and startups are so fragile like Sam mman has this weird piece about co-working spaces I don't know if you've ever read this he says that don't go to a co-working space because if you have a crazy idea and ideas like Snapchat were crazy ideas like oh you'll send a picture and it'll disappear in a minute in a co-working space other people tell you no don't do this they'll be like it's a stupid idea so you will change your mind about stupid ideas so the best ideas that come out come out in isolation or you just don't care about what people think in the early days yes so I feel like even the smallest piece of encouragement from a media company is a big deal you know I can hug you right now I genuinely love you for that because I agree to this like you know I left my job to do this I could have easily had a salaried job and had a point of view because one of the easiest thing we all can have and we all are born I think with it is a point of view point of view a negative point of view is the easiest point of view I'll tell you the the saddest part of this I have a young audience they're like 18 to 24 right sometimes I speak to them and make it as an exercise right I'm like I need to get feedback and the kids nowadays say because scud we seea fraud I'm like no where did you hear that like see the news that's the thing no if you say something nuanced if you put out five pages about something people will compress it to one line and the entire sagas that have happened with some of the founders in the last few months people have just come away thinking this entire industry is fraud I hate that because now you discourage Young Smart kids from trying hard problem absolutely ABS which is part of the game right writing or talking about someone else is a responsibility and and it's a responsibility to that business company entrepreneur to so many more people because you are shaping opinions you are influencing people to think in a certain way like edtech not whole edtech industry is a fraud edtech today you know coming from bead I am am where I am because I got education because if I didn't get education with my background with my family thing I wouldn't reach anywhere to me I think the education is the biggest thing and there's still so many nooks and corners of the country now brushing the whole Tech space and laughing about it is ridiculous things have become efficient things have become faster things have become better but yes can it create more impact can it do better and are they bad actors in in any industry in any space and again I would not say bad actors I would say with that sort of money flowing there was IR responsibility in many places but for that five people like you're saying can't shape the narrative based on those five absolutely absolutely it's a responsibility people should take more responsibility for writing stories about other people yes and of course highlight the truth like but today for me if you ask me 15 years I have also anchored on supporting The Underdogs and they're trying and more often than not if you meet young entrepreneurs you know they have such a junun in them to make a difference yeah okay so I have another set of questions is a little controversial but I think it's important for us to you know get get through this because I'm not a finance infu I'm financially idiot but I saw some of the finance influences and some of the media companies did you see that narrative shape up did you see the entire thing happening yeah and also the rule that came right so sebbi came in and they made a rule about Finance influencers I'm also a little uneducated about this so I'll just give a brief that you know some of the finance influence so there are two kinds of finance influencers my understanding of this there is a you know uh stock tips person who will on a telegram group charge 50 rupees and tell you buy this stock yeah and then there's people like Finance with sharan right who will just come do some comedy on YouTube and say hey this is how mutual funds work I feel I saw a very interesting bait and switch happened where I and one side definitely needs punishment and sebi went after that side pretty hard but I feel I saw old media really come after you know the these new age finance influencers and they went after the wrong kind of Finance influencers they went after the largest ones yeah so I know all these large creators they went after have started doing the most basic they've diluted themselves to the point of being a fortune cookie but I know the media went after them when they should have went after the stock tips guys and they put them both in the same bucket my my personal belief is I think media and content creators are in a way competitive my understanding right so what is your understanding of this do you feel like old media is looking at content creators and thinking these are different I know some people like you are saying hey you know we should it's all the same but how do you think of this like again I would not say old media versus the content creators anything anyone who's disrupting will always create a certain sort of a negative sort you know a negative backlash I think yes Financial products because people are paying should they should be responsibility to it but I don't know I I wouldn't like to comment I just think that all of us need to be little open and overall like you're saying right the space has to grow content space needs to grow and have money and good content and many content creators they can be in media they can be on YouTube they can be wherever that so you see no difference don't I don't see a difference and we shouldn't see a difference because at the end of the day an 18yearold or a 20 or a 40 or a 70y old wants to get authentic real information content and value for their time whoever is providing them my viewpoint as well right I personally think if all the old media companies just started a YouTube channel and were serious about it this is my personal like I truly believe this and just did obviously adapted to the YouTube format a little bit played a little more short form I think they would actually win right I think it's just I'm surprised that and they'll make sure that then in that way that people like us also win because some like the brand and and Brands already know that okay this this I pay an influencer and then this you know this you know platforms like mine we are no man's land because when it comes to you know there have been regulations in this space Also what do you mean like in the sense like for companies which had you know if you have investment from outside the country and all that then you know you can't like and and a certain portion and and whatever so print and TV has a lot of recognition in the country and for digital media platforms the definition itself is so fluid so Lucid that it like you can be an aggregator you could write about politics even if you're not writing about politics you're are a digital media how are you in digital like I just think that you know if you're writing current affairs or uh politics or then you this so the definition is also so unclear still in my mind because a gaming company as I said is also a media company uh or any so for that matter I would say a Creator today is also a media company in itself because if a Creator is monetizing and talking about certain stuff then they're also Media company or they're not a company so what is the definition I think that is getting completely shifted and changed and I think that needs to evolve yeah and I saw I've seen some of these channels right some of the people who are old media who are going New Media it's so simple it's like I feel like if I just spoke to them for an hour and just told them you don't do thumbnails like that because the thing is in Old media you build a reputation at Le in business with with being very serious you can't translate super seriousness to YouTube even if you want to have serious content the packaging needs to be fun so I feel like some of those if they fix I really truly think old media because they also come with the brand you know I really want now talking to you one idea came to my mind is that why I don't know if there I'm sure there would be but I love to create a forum of like a body like an industry body or a industry body again is an old word but sort of a group of creators New Media and old media together which represents overall who are invested in the space growing and not looking at their own boundaries because this is such a space where people are just competing with each other and there's no genuine collaboration and also feel like old media doesn't understand that see having a brand like say being called something your story or whatever means sure you might not have that crazy acceleration that You' have having a name right let's say Rahul or whoever on YouTube but also you have longevity you've been around for 15 years I know lots of old Medias who've been media companies who've been around 10 15 years in the YouTube space average lifespan is 3 years people say seven I don't believe that I think it's 3 to four years and after there's Maybe you can name them on like two three people who like people like T who've really been relevant more than that but I think people forget that sure they make more money in the short term but just the end of their career after that then they'll have to go back and do it's almost like they to restart their life from scratch and I've seen so many these creators after the 3 four year cycle because now I'm I've hit 30 right I've seen people who have now done this for four five years become irrelevant and have got hooked on to drugs or who are just like who are trying but it's not working you know what a loss of identity that is yeah because your name was associated with the company it's fine I mean it's still hard but fine the company shut down you can move on to the next thing but when your names gone to like zero views it's really taxing like the other side is very bad so I feel they could use with a little bit of guidance from old media where old media tells them fine this is fine build a brand right and I feel like old media could learn from New Media where new media is like package it differently that should be collaborative rather than competitive and I I just I'm so surprised it's comparative yeah I you know I'm surprised and I'm also disappointed because somewhere I just feel that we like you know I've really seen that you grow much faster if you collaborate and genuinely collaborate but somewhere people like me had to do it on our own because it was a complete write off from media companies like I always wanted as a startup entrepreneur I should be profiled like I'm just saying to that level right I like I hit the check boss the so-called checkboard entrepreneur woman entrepreneur blah blah in a difficult space is writing I've never heard an article in any Media company about me like a profiling of an entrepreneur uh so and that's interesting and if I were this thing that as a media I would support say that listen she's managed to do and doesn't have a 50y old or 100 year old Legacy company so that's very small example imagine creators today like what you're talking about like people like us all of us should be just supp I'll tell you the math is so it's so strange okay I'll tell you why I know that the new creators they're all young they're like 24 25 they would love to be featured in a money control or your story or whatever right for me it was like a dream of mine to be featured in one of these so I feel like with money if I give you money I lose some money if I if I have 10 Rupees and I give you 5 rupes I lose 5 rupees with influence with reach I don't lose anything if I get you here and I have 100,000 people see it I lose nothing right and it's the same for media old media they lose nothing in fact if you write about a Creator you gain more so I don't understand the competiveness at all it just feels like it makes perfect business sense for both sides one person gets the the influencer gets credibility these people get reach it feels like a match made in heaven it's it's it's odd that egos have come in the way or I don't know I don't know what it is that has comeing the way but I think that can be changed yeah it requires somebody to make the body like you said yeah it has to it has to and somewhere it will happen it's also nent so people are all figuring out and now with AI everyone you know the whole thing what you're saying being relevant for everyone is chasing relevancy you know like just how do you remain relevant how do you spend money is difficult in the space so it also becomes far more complicated right because everyone is figuring out the revenue the pie you know how much am I getting who is getting because for an old media it would be a Creator is taking away the money which idly they would have got or for a Creator then the challenge becomes that like you have to constantly perform constantly keep producing as a one person rather than have a team so no I agree I agree so let's do two hot takes right first thing is what is the longevity secret of your story you've been around for 15 years very few companies who've been around that long what's secret if you to say it in like three lines I have a take on this I think it's the events I think it's the face to face in the relationships you agree with that I would agree with that paranoia paranoia yeah and constantly being written off I think that is a big driver like every day I wake up and I know people are expecting that this will shut down isn't there a lot of anxiety I I felt that cuz I've run companies right it's crazy especially as your Runway starts sticking away butterflies inside the stomach every day but also forces you to do your best work yeah next subscription models I know you know a UPI is crazy right like i g i Google pay for everything yeah me too so I think subscriptions are going to be big according to a lot of people but you don't believe it to be true what's the solution what's the fix to this I know you've spoken a little bit about it before but I would like your thought anyway if there was a hypothetical word where subscriptions worked what is that word you know tokenizing it to 5 rupes 10 Rupees 15 rupes 20 rupes frictionless where like for example I'll tell you what I pay for I I paid earlier for grammarly uh because it you know it's for India they had a different pricing and you could pay and uh so if one can create like if in my mind the friction to pay is not there and I'm getting something which is very high value then it will it will work yeah I have a thought I thought about making Tex Park subscription what a lovely thought you should just be with me then all my 15 years of anxiety of Elite Card the your story card or something like that where maybe you've tied up with five hotels or 10 hotels or something I know some some entrepreneurs are trying this Hampton in the US there's a company that does this I know of saman is doing it with offline in India you have a card you already have the brand behind Tex Parks you're like hey the card gets you into Tex parks for free plus here are five cafes we've tied up with here are five co-working spaces we've tied up with youve got benefit and anyone with a card you have an app to meet other people with a card to be honest that solves the co-founder problem because you get to meet people in private spaces in person and Y uh VW work and all the other co-working spaces in India don't actually have that where you can meet other people and you know off them on a platform and you also meet them at events at Tech parks that might work as subscription I'm done I'll do it done crazy let's try it see what is there to lose I think there's a lot to gain I think if you want to convert media to subscription maybe it's not the article itself maybe it's not the content piece itself maybe that has to be free but it could be the network like you said you're not a media company it's a lot more yeah it's a network it's an ecosystem yeah and people want to meet people increasingly we want to meet relevant you know like I somebody asked me what is one takeaway you'll give to people who come to text Parx I said effectively Network that's interesting yeah would you've given me a billion dollar idea from maybe babyon I'll become a unicorn no I think I think it's the brand above all and this is like you would have tried it at some point anyway so ladies and gentlemen that was shha Sharma and thank you so much for being here one of the things one of the rituals we have on this podcast because I wanted to give something back I think people take an hour two hours of somebody else's time and this is probably exhausting for you for free for granted but we don't do that here so I have a small gift from you this is from OnePlus side this is the brand new OnePlus open this is yours their Flagship now I'm going to use it at text box yeah you can use it at text box so

OnePlus AI music studio it's going to just produce the track for you yeah it makes a video also oh that's cool ladies and gentlemen welcome to the first ever episode of OnePlus open conversations everyone was asking me am I ever going to do a podcast I didn't like the idea of a podcast but I said why not a five or six episode limited series and I'll tell you what we're doing here every the podcast it scratches the surface and weone talks about surface level stuff I said what if we can go deeper what if you can get the best people in each industry go deeper and ask them what the future in their space is going to look like so in this first episode I brought on none other than tan b t has been known for creating exceptional content over a decade he's been in many different Industries and it's very weird to see somebody win multiple spaces in content and I want to bring on T man and I didn't want to do a surface level conversation of how how is it to be a content creator I want to go deeper and I want to ask him questions like exactly how do you make a video what is the anatomy of a video how do you look at retention in a video how much money to the exact rupee can you make as a content creator and you know some of these questions when I ask these questions I'm sure there's going to be some push back and exact numbers won't be told but I will dig for the exact numbers there's also questions around how can you build creative businesses how do creators monetize their businesses how long do creators stick around and how should Brands think about content we're going to go through all of it and much more in this video so guys why are we still recording me let's get to the [Music] Pod usually me and T sitting down doing an episode of overpowered we're talking about all things AI but today I don't want to talk about AI today I have a dilemma in the last year I've been seeing every startup founder every business start their own YouTube channel correct until like 2 years ago YouTube was like a toy nobody ever took it seriously everyone said H YouTube but this year it feels like everyone's just taking it seriously everyone wants to be a Creator businesses want to be creators which is the most weird scenario to ever be in very 223 very 2023 but then again you are the OG you've been around for like OG is just a good way of saying old old and gold you've been around for a decade you've done this in repeated formats you won gaming you won uh streaming you won uh AI I began with podcasting actually a lot of people don't realize you began in podcast 2010 a began as a podcast that's how we started interesting so so tell me about the initial Journey like how did you get in like why did you even decide to do content I started off as a television writer and then standup was happening in 2008 and N DED out of college I started writing for television dude I've written everything from India's Got Talent to n with sarj Khan to uh Mt what's up the voice of youngistan I should write all that stuff and then I watched um I watched Russell Peters and I said hey I want to do that and I started doing that how old were you when you were doing this I was started writing for television when I was 1819 and then saw stand up and then I had some money left over from television then I met kba while doing standup and kba was really inspired by this podcast called WTF with Mark Marin which was the original um comedy podcast where he would document comedians lives etc etc ET really podcast for those who want to check it out there's an episode with WTF with Mark Maron where Mark Maron interviewed Robin Williams and Robin Williams spoke about his addiction issue for the first time on a podcast like at that point imagining a mainstream personality like Robin Williams talk about their Addiction on television seemed unimaginable and that's when the spark H me saying yo this is like an alternative medium that doesn't confine to the rules of traditional media so then I started listening to the podcast and I was like this is really cool we should do this for it India it was kba's idea and then I just joined him and we started off with no video audio only podcast is pre Geo time Audio Only podcast sitting like this in a literally we used to be at a sound did you call it a back then we called it a back then yeah that was the first thing and the logic with that was if people are okay with the name they'll be okay with the content which back in 2010 we started the podcast in 2010 I remember so yeah you were you were you were praising me please continue yeah no I was not praising you I was asking you for your story right there seems to be a big shift that's happened in your life from hey I was doing television writing for a company now I want to stand up now I want to start my own channel what's the big shift to taking it seriously what's the point where you were like I'm now starting to see some money out of this I think before money also there has to be pmf for enjoyment and what's pmf could you explain it product Market fit uh sorry it's Bangalore terms that I now use uh pmf for enjoyment comes first then pmf for business this comes right after first question is do you actually enjoy doing it cuz most people do it now cuz it's the thing to do but most people aren't suited for podcast or even content creation they don't enjoy doing it necessarily but they think that this is the thing to do um you don't want to do it for just the likes uh while the upsides of distribution are massive uh being a being a full-time Creator is as much of a job and a profession but more unstable and more like you you're not going you know you don't have a monthly paycheck so you don't quite know so the way to jump into it I would say is first find pmf for passion and enjoyment and when did you find that as in school only dude I always enjoyed I was um my English teacher told me that she loved my I was not a bright student until the sixth standard and the seventh standard something changed my English teacher told me that she gave me the highest in my English essay she gave me like whatever 10 on 10 and she made me stand in front of the class and she said that I want to let the whole class know that he has scored the highest because for originality and do teachers really make a difference actually when you're young and that impressional she said he's the most original of everybody in class but he wrote something original that's why that's why I like oh originality matters and I didn't even know that you could be validated for having bizarre thoughts and what about the paycheck like when did you start making money of doing content like money where you were like hey at least G you know I mean I was ring for television which back in the in 2010 I was I I would get paid um 12,000 rupees for story 12,000 rupes for screenplay 12,000 rupees for dialogue or some something how much that come out to per month what eight or nine of these a month so and when I was 19 there was like a three lakh rupe three and a half lakh rupe paycheck all of a sudden that came in every month so and I had this gig was like five 6 months so all of a sudden I saw like 10 12 lakh rupees come in and that at that point Point like that was as much money as my dad was making so it was insane so it freaked me out realiz think oh this is crazy in fact that paycheck helped me take the next sleep to stand up where I was making no money which was 2,000 bucks a night for a show at whatever you know bar in sakeet or whatever it is but I was already writing content and I saw the big bucks so to say early on and God bless the producers who also enabled me to take that kind of thing cuz they were also like he's a young kid who's different from the rest and he's original or whatever so to say that's why they were able to pay me that much I was writing a daily sitcom for Disney and ababi saw its first real check from our first live show we started selling out 2,000 CER auditoriums around the country and do the ma right 200000 into roughly 399 4.99 average ticket how much is that whatever six lak 7 lakh rupees split between the four of us minus costs so that I think 2012 was the first year where I started seeing significant money at you probably made 10 12 laks that year but took you like probably 3 4 years to catch up to the paycheck that you were making at your previous company yes my previous gig as a television writer took about took about 3 four years uh but I had savings from my previous gig that's why I was able to give that 3 four years of you know transition to New Media um that's why even now I tell people saying first find find if you enjoy doing it and if you're able to do it for 3 years without really feeling like I want to go back to my job unless you're doing it fulltime time and you're aggressively outputting so much you can really make content while you have another job no you can it's not it's not that hard I think you're able to take time out so I think that's the advice I would give most people take your time do it while you're doing a job and then once you think that okay I can go a year just doing nothing else but this then you take that LE one of the things about creating content that I've seen right you've just been around for very long but it's not been the same tme like it's not today is not a t it's very different thank Lord thank the Lord right so it feels like and it's not like it's just one jump right it's been several jumps it's almost like you've never settled yeah that's true so so the question is what was the driving Factor behind those jumps A and B do other people also need to do that to stay relevant long term oh 100% I think I think I got really lucky because dude if you can write content really well you understand the basics of how content works and if you understand the basics then you're able to the principles of making content don't change across mediums I've written for television film radio U I've written Holdings print ads Jingles songs YouTube videos I've written corporate shows I've written all kinds of stuff you know it's a very interesting Insight I'll tell you why the average person on the internet looking at Tas will think hey tan is funny T is a improv comedian but what I'm hearing is there's just so much writing behind what you do years and years of years of writing like a decade of non-stop output dude I worked with in V's company weird ass where we outputed like seven or eight uh 90minut live comedy shows then I wrote like 300 sketches for aib before that was 3 four years of daily sitcom writing for Disney before that was all the writing Ed in college and school so really all of this put together is now me today where it feels second nature but it's years of writing that's what I'm saying if you understand how to write and construct then you can do this sort of stuff in in your sleep um I I've said this before which is your ability to exercise judgment only gets stronger if your feedback loops are shorter and faster if you're able to create something out of thin air put it in front of an audience have the audience respond and then go reiterate if you do this hundreds and thousands of times over only then do you really get good at your job um which most people aren't able to do that either because their job doesn't allow them to but this is like as I heard son Nigam say on beer B podcast recently which I thought was a good phrase chab you have to spend your time just chewing the craft of whatever it is that you're doing so if you're a good content creator how much writing do you think per year the work entails like is it a book's worth is it two books worth it's 10 books worth at least so about a th Pages a year thousand Pages a year yeah I would be outputting a th Pages a year easy cumulatively yeah off off the Thousand Pages maybe 100 or 50 would be usable but you got to put out that thousand pages is there scope for a content creator who can't write who just wants to do everything improv yeah there is there is you can you can be that sort of a person but know that if you're going to improvise your way through or if you're going to make content then you're not going to be really good until you make like a hours of content like you just have to Output that much for you to get really good at what you do but why why is it important to make content what are the benefits of making content today like why are businesses doing it and should a business owner or should an employee of a business watching this make content either personally or as the business first let's talk about why individuals should make content I think nsay put this very well which is in the old day you could either be a doctor or you could be a lawyer right today is the generation of ands which is you can be a doctor and and something else you can be a lawyer and something else and more often than not this is doctor and content creator with it for individuals the upside is very clear it's every piece of media that you output online could have asymmetric could have any asymmetric bet uh there's the novel tweet which is what are some things that have asymmetric returns reading a book has asymmetric returns going on a date has as asymmetric return what is an asymmetric return for the AUD which means most things in life have symmetrical returns which is is if you do X then you get X returns you keep doing this and there's linear growth this is what most people experience in a job also which is if you're renting your time out every year the amount of rent increases if you're working out then the more you work out the more your muscles increase asymmetric returns is where if you put in X you could get any output it could be really really dramatically bigger than what you thought so let's take an example right if you go out on 10 Dates going out on a date and meeting someone new has asymmetric symmetrical returns how only one out of these 10 needs to be so compatible with you you could find a life partner imagine spending 15 hours and getting a life partner like that's a dramatically outsized return like you got something insane imagine reading a book and you get a startup idea or you get a a way to think that changes your life dramatically like live example is I read a book called the Obesity code by Jason fun I read it twice three times over since then I've lost like 58 kilos that one book just changed how I think and I probably saved myself five or six years that's why making media gives you asymmetric asymmetrical returns because you don't know who's going to watch it at the other end 10 years ago 20 years ago when media was centralized if you made something it would go linearly today because media is decentralized it's almost like veins arteries in Your Heart Right like you don't know where it ends up with so imagine you put out a tweet about a certain insight about your profession that tweet has say 900 views of those 900 one of them could be vun Maya or t right and you see this and you go like oh this this person is interesting I'm just going to follow so you can't control like you don't know who's going to be at the other end would would a better way to put this be that a lot of success is luck like a lot of inbound deal flow is luck but creating distribution increases your surface are of luck aib's example is really is really interesting here how did we get access two movie stars as a Ashish shakya used to write a column for Hindustan times he used to write a humor column for Hindustan times he used to write one every week for years right and then Twitter happened and he joined Twitter and he started putting out these columns on Twitter one day KY followed him CU she just happened to read the article she liked it next week we wrote A Sketch and we directly dm'd KY saying hey would you like to would like to be be in the video we made that video and that's another piece of media that we output that that went viral next day we on badat show that like an Arjun Kapoor or someone saw it and then followed us on Twitter then once Arjun and ranir sing followed us on Twitter that led to aibb knockout right like it's you couldn't have predicted you couldn't have planned there's just no way there's just no way you could have planned it but it wouldn't have happened if Ashish Shaka didn't write that column he was outputting it every week it me and kba would not have met if kba wasn't tweeting funny jokes dude me and Rohan met because of because of outputting media Rohan was a columnist at JT and I used to love that magazine so I followed I followed Rohan then I followed his Blog then one day Rohan spoke about um hey there's an opening here or whatever and then I applied through that and then me and Rohan met through that so I think a lot most of my um lucky um serender pitus moments all have happened because of someone has outputed something into the world and it just happened to reach me and I think every individual should have that opportunity by by just put out your stuff in the in the world and the arteries will carry it to someone or the other and the algorithms are just trying to determine how fast you can your content can flow that's why you need to understand how platforms work so you can maximize your asymmetric bet interesting and do you feel like at bigger and bigger levels of scale at your diseasing level levels of scale do you feel like the compounding there is incredible like these lucky moments that you're pulling off do you think absolutely and and how does it work for a brand what is the usefulness for a company let's say I run a d2c company what's the point your best hires could come from your content um zato makes really killer content right like so akar started off making content zato now zomato's team is so strong because there are creative people around the country who would see zomato's work and be like they make really cool I want to work there the same thing happened with Ked same things happened with Ked now it's become aspiration to want to to want to want to work there so if a business makes good content it has outsized returns just from a attracting quality talent and it's not just that you know if you make good content as a company it increases NPS of employees who work at that company you know how cool it feels if you're if you work at a company and on your friend WhatsApp group someone shares an Instagram posting have you seen this is really cool you get to be in that group and be like yo this is the company that I work for money can't buy that you can't run performance advertising and buy that kind of in so you're saying content increases or improves culture internal culture 100% uh employee NPS D it people feel proud of um when you when you work for a brand that makes good content a good example is I was talking to sashank who runs the whole truth right the whole the whole company is so passionate about what they do uh it's because of so much so much has to do with the content that they output it's not just that dude it's not just the content quality is really good when when content is really good then the comments are really good when comments are really good you start feeling pride in Pride and Joy in what you do if you feel pride and joy in what you do you put in 120% it's all connected so having a Cool brand uh that does cool content has effects that you cannot you like you can't put that on on paper it's hard to judge a lot of companies will fret over like I keep telling them like okay if it's if the budget for something is like 50 lakhs Roi has to Bei has to be whatever it is I'm like like you know having a good relationship with the people who are making the stuff for you all that stuff matters because relationships are everything like I would I would happily take a hit for five lakhs if I can work with a company where the process of working was way easy I actually can verify that because I've seen that behind the scenes T doesn't think so much about the cash if he's looking at a company and he really likes the company I'm just like it just be a breeze to work with these guys and like you want to you you want to have minimal one night stands more relationships with with this sort of stuff so let's move to the next piece right I wanted this to be like a master class in making content break down the anatomy of a video for me I think there are two kinds of videos roughly right there's a long form video maybe 10 20 30 minutes and then there's short form videos 1 minute yeah I'm a new I'm a kid I want to win at the content game I have the ability to do long form and shortform let's say I'm a I I make for a daily uh living I go to school and I make some money on the side maybe I'm doing some freelance gigs or something what should I start doing what what kind of content should I start making how should I think about the video look long form content is being successful at long form content is the Holy Grail right why is that the Holy Grail over short form uh it's pretty simple you want people to watch you many times for longer periods of time okay let's take I've seen 30 Shah ruk Khan movies which means I spent you know 150 200 hours of Shah ruk Khan on the big screen uh I made the effort of leaving my house going to the theater paying for the ticket and then watching him which means I put in so much effort to watch this guy at the end of it I really liked it that's why now I if Shah ruk Khan is in front of me I will palpitate right um now the friction to consuming long form is it's it's obviously not similar but there is more friction to con to uh convincible to watch long form videos a time commitment I have to watch it I have to have context built up I have to and there also double optin right with shs you just appear on their feet here you feet here you have to click so if people put in effort to watch you a getting them to do that is higher so if you get them to do that they're likely to and if they do this three four five times over they're likely to like you more plus if someone watches you for longer it just means that they like you more like it's as simple as that short video like you said short video is a scrolling habit which is you just happen to show up on their feed you ting them for 30 seconds and unless that 30 second is so good they're not coming to your profile and then watching 10 other videos even if you do short form video if you are able to be a format that someone watches you once and they go to your profile and then watch 10 of those videos then you truly make an impression you make more of an impression if you last in front of someone's eyes for longer it's as simple as that having said that that is the Holy Grail of long form but if you like I would optimize for finding pmf for passion and enjoyment right and you don't enjoy it if you're not doing well if you make content and nobody sees it you don't enjoy the process you're like what am I doing wasting wasting my time so if you're going to start out I would recommend short form because likelihood of you finding some traction and getting that first dopamine hit of ah someone saw my that is higher in short form so if you're just starting out you want to try and get your first you know thousand views on a short form video and getting your first thousand views uh you need to make a half decent video get get all your friends to share it on their story and let the algorithm do its thing how many friends if you had to put a number on it that's how many of friends like 10 20 yeah if you 10 depends on how many followers they have you know but if one of your friends is Varun Maya and has 200,000 followers on Instagram then that's just Varun Maya has enough so it's not how many friends it's just about increasing your odds of letting the letting the how sorry did I get 200,000 wrong is it how much is it it's 400 400,000 sorry my bad um so it's donon said this recently we I asked him on a thing saying would you pick uh someone who's talented or confident he said I would always pick the guy who's who's feeling more confident because the odds of success or someone who feels confident is much higher you can have you can have a lot of talent but if you're not feeling good you're likely not going to succeed um so I think confidence inspires luck in some sense right so if you're starting out I want you to feel confident I want you to feel cocky and feel like I got this I'm actually going to crush it maybe is not the right word but I want you to feel inspired and if you want to feel inspired likelihood of success is higher in short form so start short form and then eventually see how you can pivot that audience into doing something long form it's harder to build a strong community on short form have you changed your mind on short form I have I have um I I wasn't a fan of shortarm stuff A couple of years ago since then a bunch of things changed I had a big problem with doing shortform on YouTube because there was no way for you to do short form and long form on one Channel without it either looking ugly YouTube suffers from a disease where a Channel's purpose is unidimensional people subscribe to a channel because they expect a or X out of this channel so you can't do multiple different formats on a channel back in the day now YouTube changed it to you can literally each channel can do long form videos they have a podcast button so under the same channel you can also do podcast and the same channel you can also do shs earlier when I subscribed to a channel I was subscribed to a type of content now when I subscribed to a channel I've subscribed to this brand of content so as a Creator I now have more options I will show up either as a as a podcast on the podcast feed or as shorts on the shorts feed so now the product is much better so now I think if you're doing a 100K views for example um if you're doing a 100K views and if you also do shorts with it you you're likely would of getting that 1 million views is higher on a sh than on that 100K views again this is this is like the algorithm and all that stuff is like it's complicated and you know there are many variables to it but anecdotally this is this is what I said I change my view on short form primarily because it's my sense is it's easier lower effort to bang out that one minute one minute video um and your Chan of hitting that one golden 50 million view is higher in short form because you get to take more shots if if you can make five short form videos a day but it takes you a week to make one long form video you want to start off with short form cuz if you take 50 shots one of them is going to hit so you change your mind on shorts because you did see outcomes and at the same time you feel like it's much easier to produce so short form while you say the reason why I said said this was that quote unquote short form is not easy it's easier than to produce it's easier to produce like the barrier to entry to short form is is a lot easier than producing a slightly higher quality long form video it just takes lesser time to edit just takes lesser time to edit now on Instagram like Instagram basically killed inshots right like I don't know if you saw but now you can make a real and it's as good as inshots within Instagram you can I remember in college you know the editing timeline it used to be okay this is video this is audio and transitions would be little things in the middle all this is on your phone now it's insane like I'm I'm using basically FCP on my phone at this point and you once told me something about the anatomy of a video you you used to give me the example of BuzzFeed tasty yeah where you said that actually I'll let you explain it you should tell the audience what makes a good video what is the algorithm look for at the heart of whether it's long form short form television shows movies at the heart of it it's all the same can I retain the viewer till the end it's as simple as that the example that I gave was tasty tasty would begin with like it would be top down video of like the first a plate would come in and then you know that'd be the base of pizza then the cheese would go on top of it and they chop the whatever pepperoni and it would go on top of it then the thing goes goes outside frame and you know it's blank you see a shot of it going inside the oven when it comes out it's finally ready and you're waiting for that golden shot of lifting the pizza like this and the cheese and all all of it is there from the beginning of the video there was a promise that something cool is going to happen in the end and this is what makes retention go up really high let's take overow as an example right the first two episodes of overpowered was what us like theorizing about Ai and there was a lot of like just us talking until eventually I like let's just make this tasty which is let's just demo AI tools because AI tools are inherently like making a pizza at the start of it it's like hey this tool promises you to do XY Z now let's watch it in action and that's that's the aha moment the oven moment which like oh it's it's ready isn't that isn't that insane that's a nice word the oven moment the oven moment it's it's where you wait for the oh this happens and if you notice every single trend on Instagram is basically this the oven moment the oven moment which is build up anticipation deliver on that anticipation it's every single trend is this take moo moo like when a mo when when a real shows up and I see below there's this that Moo song thing is going on I just know that oh all this  dialogue is going to eventually end up with like five people doing moo at the end of it like every single trend is basically this whether it is the thing about your head saying which movie character are you whether it is you know put your head on my shoulder where it flips to a silhouette of you in like whatever every single trend is something cool is going to happen in the end I feel like YouTube has gone from you know your subscriber numbers don't matter as much as they did back in the day because now I have subscribed to like 300 channels when I open YouTube it's not going to rec off those 300 channels on a Thursday evening if I open YouTube there are like 50 different things I've consumed on YouTube where the YouTube algorithms like he's interested in these 50 different things very low on the priority is the channels that he has subscribed to maybe if I subscribed to a channel and watch more than four videos will it even continue recommending that video to me um but yeah packaging packaging matters for retention like you can get someone to watch your videoos subscribe but if you want to retain them you got to get them to click like three more times only then does you the algorithm feel like this person should be shown overpowered video often overpowered could have 300,000 subscribers but we have variable views right like some episodes do 200k views some episodes do 50k views that has stopped mattering as much it's the it's what happened with Tik Tok on Tik Tok you could have 10 followers but you could have three 8 million plus view uh shs but your follower could go from 10 to just 300 it doesn't matter I think that's slowly happening to YouTube as well as platforms get more saturated things get even more uneven which is a good thing I think variable rewards in life are D variable Rewards is what makes uh the rat continue running on the treadmill there's this really interesting experiment that was done at Sanford they took like a bunch of rats they put them in water and they they was all like trying to swim trying to make sure that they don't die then after 20 minutes they took the rats out and they dried them and they made them feel like okay you're you're fine now and 5 minutes later they put them back into water okay how long do you think the rats kept paddling to be alive how long I assume the fact that they kept pulling them out gave the rats hope in a way yes and the water restrain stress this is called the water restrain stress test ah so you keep dumping the rat into water but if you leave it in the water it eventually gives up yeah but if you keep taking it out the rat is still like at some point I'm going to be taken out this survived for five days five days they kept paddling right this is what variable rewards does so it's in every platform's interest to give the Creator variable rewards because if you get one success then then you think that the next video could be the next success the next video after that could be it you just need to see one 10K views and then you're like bro this is golden I'm there you just need that first one like ever since we got 12 million on that one overpowered reel every video you want it to be that so you just know that that's what's possible t h how much money do content creators make and I think you should you should tabulate it into how much does a content creator of the 100K views make how much a content creator with a million views make and if you're working with brands does your subscribe account actually matter if you get 100K views on short video either on Instagram you make no money if you have short video on YouTube it's minuscule right like you could get 10 million views and get a 2,000 rupe payout like it's short video doesn't the short video revenue revenue on all the platforms is minuscule next to nothing so you can't make a you can't make a living based on Advertising Revenue through short video on long form your RPM which is revenue per melee which is how much money are you getting per thousand monetized playbacks on YouTube can range anything between whatever 50 to 150 depending on the genre you are in so if it's if it's on the lower end I suspect like um genres like gaming or vlogging would be on the lower end cuz the audience for that is more generic could be younger as well so whatever do the math right if you if you get a million views then maybe you have whatever 5 600,000 of those be monetized so 500 into uh whatever 50 60 100 150 that's that's the kind of numbers you would see if you have a more premium audience which is for example like if you have a if you have 100,000 subscribers but say 2,000 of those subscribers are YouTube pre premium viewers uh then you get more YouTube premium just means that someone who is paying to not have ads on on YouTube A View From that person generates more so um so it really really depends on what genre you're in like if you if you do Finance stuff I know Finance stuff pays uh the revenue RPMs on finance videos are a lot higher uh RPMs on podcasts are also pretty high uh because in an in an hourong podcast if someone if your average view time is 30 minutes which is MTI you're getting multiple ads so each view you generate a lot more you know 2x 3x but me a rough number no like forget about RPM tell me like a Creator maybe in comedy who has a million subscribers or let's say in gaming who has a million subscribers what can they expect from what what do they see on their Channel dashboard if you get a million views uh on the higher end you'll make one lakh rupees on the higher end is what I've noticed so let's let's say they make they're putting out four videos a month so they're getting making four lakhs from YouTube they could if they are making if they're getting a million views they could on the higher end 1 million views one lakh uh one lakh Rupees is on the higher end uh but if you get like you should be able to make at least like 30 40 50 60k in that range you should be able to make that irrespective of the genre you are in but all it's like this is like I'm still talking about if you get these as an established Creator because L of this depends on you know is the sales team pushing your channel as something that uh whose inventory gets pocketed off if you are a part Ned partnered Channel at YouTube if you fall in the light right genre where for example you're in um towards the end of the year ad sales go up a lot more where brands have more money to push their products um then more channels have more inventory uh filled up uh but yeah if if you're generating a million views then you're probably going to get more money from Brand deals than YouTube at Revenue uh but if you get a million views in say a finance category you can charge upwards of 15 20 lakhs per integration this is not like YouTube paying you money this is you going to a brand and saying I will talk about your thing for a minute yeah yeah yeah if you're an established Creator and you do short form also like I know creators who are charging 15 lakhs to make even a real um I know creators who who who've been paid like 35 40 lakhs to make a real like I've like the the deals really depends on who you are what is your brand how premium are you who are the people who are managing you what so you're saying it's less about the views or it's a mix of the views and what people think of and they think what people think of you what it's a mix of views what genre you're in and what is your perception as as a Creator like I know I know creators who don't do that many deals and they'll just be like listen I'm going to do like five deals a year and it's going to come at a premium and I'm only only going to work with you know the coca-colas of the world which like top tier brand so I know creators like that also but I know other creators who are like dude I'm producing like 80 videos a year this is inventory that's going was uh that's going waste I might as well monetize just take it deal by take it deal by deal so there's no there's no direct like oh if you do X then you get y really depends on who you are what your brand is so at a million views a video let's say four videos a month I'm producing and I'm producing maybe say 20 shots a month you think it's possible for me to make a million dollars a year as if I was a new let's say old content creator from ad Revenue unlikely but yeah if you're pulling I think if you're pulling in whatever upwards of 25 30 million views a month on YouTube uh which would put you in like the top 2 three percentile creators 0.1 that's top 0.1% yeah top 0.1% I'm talking views which are not short driven views which are purely long form if you're able to pull in 30 million views a month with an average watch time of you know five to six minutes you are you will make a million dollars a year uh between branded content and AD Revenue it's possible it's very very much possible to do that uh um but if if you are a YouTuber scoring big numbers on long form consistently then dude you don't even need to be dependent on branded content after a point right like you you can pull in uh you can pull in like 20 30 lakhs a month on YouTube if you're pulling in you know that many views uh you're basically earning the salary of a CEO comfortably um so it's it's possible to make really good money on YouTube but it's a grind like then your your job is you're you're available 365 days you have to produce content whenever absolutely your life is on sale I've seen creators who get to the scale who just don't want to work with Brands anymore really yeah like they make enough money just it's not it's not about the money it's more about like sometimes it's difficult to work with Brands yeah right so many of those creators decide I want to start a business now yeah which is which is a smarter rout to take but have you seen any successful Creator business in India the jump from Creator to service businesses is pretty easy I've seen fewer successes in d2c it's because if you're a very successful Creator the odds of you making so much money from just Brands is higher uh whereas the odds of starting a business and really putting in the effort to make that successful it takes it takes a lot of commitment and effort the model that I've seen work with a lot of creators is you know you become successful as a public brand then you find and team up with a co-founder who has the expertise in a particular business so your job becomes more about creating Network effects really lever bridging your your position creating top of funnel for for the business uh but I think top of funnel is also diminishing there's only so many times with your audience unless you keep generating newer audiences uh like someone like a duu raati will generate newer audiences all the time because he talks about basically watching the news right and everybody cares about the news so you see anything that happens in the news is a new audience that that comes to watch him um but if you are like if you're a Creator like me I have a very loyal um low attrition kind of audience which is people will come watch watch like you know six videos by me every month so if I tell you to click on one it's unlikely you're going to click on it more than once so really depend on the kind of creator that you are but there are different models you can do you can be a Creator and monetize your audience which is you can either sell courses or you can you know teach something you can do whatever it is you can be a Creator and start a new business this could be a d2c business it could be a service business or if you're a Creator and you find a partner and run multiple businesses like I fall into to the third category which is um I now have a wide range of interests and I have access in different areas and then I find co-founders in different but that also works for you because you have channels in different areas that are all working yes I have channels in different areas and more importantly my range of interest is fairly wide I'm interested in content also I'm interested in AI also I'm interested in you know startups Angel Investing d2c brand I'm interested in a bunch of things um so I can speak the language and I can really communicate with Founders that I work with in that language but it's not not for everyone but if you're a successful Creator then the part to making money there are there are many as long as you're able to keep your public brand sustained if you could go to Brands today who are trying to do YouTube I'm talking about companies and you can give them two or three pieces of advice what would it be because you worked with so many brand managers who get YouTube wrong I would tell brand managers to start off with short video because I think uh you you're able to your feedback loop is faster brand managers will really know you know what kind of cont content suits their brand so I would say first start with dip your feet in short video create a dedicated team how much should they budget I mean it's it's at least five hires right you'll need you'll need one brain one or two brains either what would you call that role like a Creator in Residence let's say Creator and residence or let's call them both producers talent and producer okay sometimes the producer is the talent sometimes producer is separate and talented so presenter and producer presenter producer um then i' I'd probably say twoed and if you want an in-house camera production person then you can have that and or you can R so like a director of production director of production or you can also rent that like the producer can do it uh but it's tough for a producer to manage the content also and the production also like we are very lucky to have Saga who can who can do bit of both but most people aren't able to do that uh depends on the kind of content you're doing if you're doing like Finance videos for example your producer will really focus on what is the content that you're that you're making the scripts really matter cuz you're talking about money and you want to be careful with what what you say publicly uh but say you you're making food videos so a producer can think of formats and just set up the production place and Outsource the production and uh then really goad so tell me the exact math how much should I spend on a studio like I'm a brand I need to produce a short form video every day I would say if you're a brand just starting out you want to Outsource production initially do a pilot where you Outsource production but have the key stakeholders which is the producer people yeah not the five people includes two editors but you can Outsource that also but I think you need to have an in-house producer SL brand custodian who will really think of what is the content that's going to go out um rest everything you can Outsource in the beginning you can use a company like AOS which is you know Varun I and a bunch of other cool people at AV are involved in you can Outsource it do a pilot I think really what you need as a brand to make content is intent and one person to own it be the brand cust Stan who has the best judgment on this content suits my brand the rest you can Outsource how do you find that person ooh the best people to for this job are people who have built distribution themselves I think they are the best people to be running this ship for you um if you haven't done content before then you're going to make some bad decisions if you are responsible to to deploy Dollar on producing content so I think creators would be a good bet I think most companies eventually there'll be enough creators in the market who could not make big top dollars as creators um but they would make for killer uh content marketing people inside companies yeah I think I think more brand should be hiring creators in house for sure uh even if it's if even if it's not permanently I think even as a consultant uh CU your content team really needs to think like a like a Creator it's not it's not it's not something you can half as it's not making content is an always on job it's not a IPL campaign you know December campaign it is all year long so it's not a it's not a half as you can't half as it you got to be on it all the time that's why I think more people will hire creators what is what is your team composed of right now what does your team look like primarily editors and one producer I have two editors and one producer for my YouTube three people three people is for my YouTube andan you're doing uh like camera setup and stuff the producer does that I do everything on Zoom so I don't want to do wait I got to do nothing uh I have one producer whose job is to curate the content for me what I what I react to on the podcast side I have a producer and an editor then on the agency front there is you know couple of writers and me and Thea who are the co-founders um and that's moonshot that's moonshot then on overpowered there's you know there we have two editors and and a producer uh so they're all small small teams like pods highly efficient you know sing Single focus on on on what they're doing it becomes hard if you get one person to context switch with all the different things that I'm doing it's hard for one person to to be able to do all of that um so yeah teams in in silos with a singular focus on on what they're doing interesting yeah this was fantastic I learned so much and you know I always keep saying this right I think proximity to a good Creator makes you a good Creator like I know there are creators who who you know gone solo and won really big but I think that takes a long time takes like 5 six years but I think the minute you spend time very closely with a bigger Creator and you see them do their thing behind the scenes I think it accelerates your career if you ever want to be a Creator or want to create content you are the product of the fight 10 people you surround yourself with so I think I've learned so much from being around you and I just wanted to make sure that the audience also got to hear some of our behind the scenes conversation hope it was useful and if if it wasn't then please write and I'm sure someone will afford that comment so by the way we have a ritual here this is the first episode I want to make this like a habit for the next I just want to do like a five six episode series and then be done okay we give everyone a gift excellent this is the OnePlus open this is the OnePlus open you using you're using the phone right what do you like about it it has all the benefits of a tablet it has all the benefits of a phone and if I ever get bored of the tablet view like I'm I get bored very quickly so it's like I really like this I love how it feels when you when you fold it there's no the the crease is almost invisible like all the other ones like creas this one's like invisible it's really nice and I heard the cameras Stellar this is a collaboration with hustle blood yeah check this out I can do this really cool thing on a on the camera okay oh the dual view you can have the back camera and the front camera this perfect for vlogging I'm recording you but you can see what's being recorded oh that's cool so I can record as and you can say oh this is great actually to shoot reals and stuff yeah so if your producer is recording you you know exactly what's being recorded at the same time you can do your job he can do his job it makes it just makes short content easier yes that was an exhausting conversation but hey I learned a lot and everything that I thought I could pull out of tme that I thought the audiences need to know I got and I'm very excited that t had the time to do this and I hope you liked it I'm going to do just five of these I'm going to get the best in each industry and I'm going to learn from their insights go very very deep all you have to do is like share and subscribe you know what I really like about OnePlus is not just the hardware it's also software like they launched this thing called the OnePlus AI music studio okay so I can go I can select EDM I can select romantic I can select travel and I just proceed and I can describe the vi three genres that have nothing to do with you but sure yeah but whatever let's say under the city lights what that's the name of the song I'm just writing something under the city lights right what should your song be about and wait it's going to just produce the track for you that's what I like about OnePlus it's not just the hardware it's also like they really think through the software so even their OS and all looks so cool oh it's ready no way wow it really feels like I'm under the city lights yeah R is performing I think they're doing a event they're doing a festival dude it makes a video also that's sick sure look at this it makes a video also oh that's cool"}

the caste system very very very old but India is also adopting the most recent technology in the form of blockchain both those words have combined 65 000 cast certificates have been issued on the polygon blockchain what a collision of words one in Ancient India that has been around for Millennia and another a company that is on the edge of Technology colliding it can only happen in this country the most amazing fact about India is that we are now the fastest growing economy in the world for financial year 2022 to 2023 our GDP is sitting at 3.5 trillion dollars making us number one in terms of growth the services sector in India no not products Services people sitting and working at TCS and Accenture and companies like that contributes to more than 50 percent of our GDP the crown jewel is the it and BPM sectors that contributes to over 80 percent of exports it directly employs about 5 million people and indirectly supports 12 million people so next time you see somebody in the comments saying yeah don't learn coding it's not important I just want to tell you how much of our GDP and exports relies on coding in fact I believe in it so much now I made an investment in a friend's company who are planning to solve this coding Problem by actually picking up these students teaching them giving them jobs helping them ship their services abroad no this part is not promoted it's just how much I believe in that concept and how much it actually contributes to our GDP next I want to run through some macro Factor 1 lakh 96 000 is our per capita income this is actually far behind China even though we say India is better than China this that China's per capita income is still close to 13 000 we have a 1.4 billion population scheduled to take over China and become the world's largest population this year the cool thing is that China's average age is 38 our average age is 28 which means means we have 10 years of potential power more to make something miraculous happen while the world's inflation is sitting at 8.8 percent our inflation is 6.8 percent which means we're doing fairly healthy in a bad economic climate our Equity market cap is 3.5 trillion not the kind of entrepreneur raising hundreds of millions and building the next food delivery app these are small and medium Enterprises sometimes sole proprietorships in the U.S there are 1 million retail stores in India we have 12 million retail stores which is 12 million entrepreneurs 65 million small medium Enterprises of whom 70 are sole Proprietors our formal organized Workforce is just 10 of the population this is why when I say AI is coming and many jobs are going to go and only the top one or two percent is going to be employed when I say that a lot of people look at me and say how can one percent being employed support the entire population well it's not that the rest are going to be unemployed many of them are going to be unemployed yes but many are going to start their own thing and it's already like that today 10 organized formal Workforce supports everybody else along with the entrepreneurs that make up the rest next let's talk about online we have lots of online users we have 850 million internet users more than half of India is sitting online or with 600 million users are smartphone users but the funnel gets interesting only 350 million of them transact once a year online that's it just once a year and more online 185 million a consistent online shoppers but just 45 million are mature internet users who make up 50 of the wallet spent online in fact one of the cool things about my audience that I've learned over the years is that if you are watching me you are part of that mature internet user base very likely part of that mature internet user base the reason we have such a high top of the funnel is because of very cheap bandwidth and very cheap data plans mobile data pricing is one of the lowest in the world just slightly above Israel but the amount of data we consume one of the highest amounts in the world the good part about this is that it leads to massive user bases for apps in the country WhatsApp has 500 million users in the country YouTube has 467 million users in the country these are massive numbers in fact out of 600 million smartphone users 500 million use WhatsApp imagine that level of penetration as a business except WhatsApp and YouTube If you combine all the other social apps in India that total advertising market cap is totally a 4.5 billion dollar market tiny number in fact in 2022 Snapchat alone in the US earned more from ad spend than all of these companies put together it's not just with advertisements anything that is consumer in India have much smaller numbers than we imagined for example there are only 37 million unique mutual fund investors in the country that is much smaller than we thought it would be there are only 35 to 40 million unique credit card holders in the country only 13 of students who study between 1st and 12th standard in India pay more than 1000 rupees a month in school fees imagine school fees in less than 12 000 rupees a year is the norm for India if you've been to a school that costed you more than that per year you're among the top 13 richest in this country and to top it off only 7.5 percent of households in India owns a car a car is a good proxy for whether you are lower military class and above or below and only 7.5 percent of Indian households owns a car so if you do own a car congratulations you won the lottery behind this there's an undersized consuming class less than 12 percent of India make less than one lakh 30 000 a year 50 of India makes between a lakh and 4 lakhs a year if you make between 4 lakhs and 31 lakhs a year you are among the top 38 in the country and if you make more than 31 lakhs per year you are in the top five percent of this country incredible numbers the next slide shows the doglapan these two India we have an India that cares a lot about the avocado the avocado is supposed to be a Premium Fruit it symbolizes a Premium Fruit and there's a populace of India who live in India who thinks that everyone has that premium lifestyle and at the same time in that same compound there are probably many people that's represented by the banana there's a show called decoupled in which there's an artist who shows an avocado and a banana an avocado is supposed to be a Premium Fruit only some people in the world can afford it but India has such a medley of population that we have people who love the avocado and the common man who is given only the banana is ironic because I'm somebody who hates the avocado I love the banana I think it's a 1 wonderful fruit symbolizes that there are two indias living in one place in fact as we go through the report we'll see that it's more than two indias in fact it's probably three or four like we mentioned in the last video India 1 has 120 million people and produces 1.4 trillion of GDP India 2 has 100 million people and produces 300 billion dollars of GDP the difference between India 1 and India 2 is India one has a lot of regular transactors online they spend a lot India too spend occasionally once in a while and India 3 has 1 200 million people but produces only 1.8 trillion dollars in GDP they are 10 times the size of India 1 but produce only 20 to 25 percent more than India won in terms of GDP even though they have 10 times the Manpower unfortunately the report has realized after lots of research that these people are non-monetizable users sure they will come they will use your app they will have fun but the minute you ask them to pay money they will not pay simply because they don't have enough most apps are now targeting India one Netflix credit dunzo Etc because they realize that's the same GDP whether you go after India one or India 3 except you need to hit 10 times more users and the cost of acquisition just catapults when you're going after 10 times the number of users imagine your ad spent but if you go to India one you need to capture less number of people and you're able to monetize them better because they are regular online transactors but here's an interesting stat that was not captured the last time outside of India one two and three there is an Indian diaspora which is the people who are from India but don't live in India they are abroad they send back in insane amount of money I've lived here for more than 30 years I came from Andhra Pradesh Bangalore I'm basically from Kerala I was born in Mumbai the Indian diaspora transferred 100 billion dollars in 2022 back to the country which is more than the foreign direct investment into this country imagine your relative or your Chacha who's gone abroad and sending money back all them combined are pumping more money into this country then all the top investors sitting outside of India combined the next few slides of this report cover the fact that lots of new startups are emerging in small towns in India and it's so weird we used to have a generation where a tier one person used to do an MBA and then build products for the rest of India we now have a person sitting in India 2 and India 3 building for India one it is a weird transformation of the country where anyone from anywhere backed by local Angel Investors can start a company it is truly an exciting time to be in and shows like Shark Tank have given visibility to many of these small time Founders it's also mainstream entrepreneurship never in my career did I think more people would understand the plight of somebody who has raised money then today after Shark Tank denotable conversation not something I have to spend half an hour explaining to somebody when I meet them the next thing is that the base of direct and indirect taxpayers has been growing and GST has been a huge hit in expanding the taxpayer base in mid-2017 6 million companies paid GST in India today that's 14 million companies income taxpayers went from 40 million in 2015 to 63 million in 2021 and there's also rising formalization in India in fact I was talking to my cook and I was telling her if she can come twice a day and she said that I've started an agency therefore I am quitting so everyone's organizing everyone's getting together and this is being supported by the digital infrastructure of the country on the identity side we have aadhar we have e kyc we have digital signatures and online repositories payments as you know we have the backbone in terms of UPI in terms of data sharing things like account aggregator that have now come in that allow you to link your SBI account and your HDFC account and all the other accounts which allows us to trust people more but there's one big difference in how China has done this and how India has done this and this is very commendable in China all of this is owned by the government it's one centralized entity and if they don't like you you're out but in India this power was handed over to the private companies like phone pay and paytm the advantage with this is if paytm treats you badly you can always go to phone pay and if phone pay treats you badly you can always go to the others it reminds me of my college when I was in manipal in college there was only one internet service provider which was BSNL and trust me they treated everybody badly until competition stepped in which is a good thing for the market UPI payments have been going berserk from 585 000 crores in 2018 it is now 12 and a half million crores in 2022 in fact UPI payments to Merchants are now bigger than debit cards and credit cards combined what a crazy story for UPI and just like UPI India is also bringing in ondc which allows any vendor to have the infrastructure that Amazon and Flipkart provide their vendors without being pushed around by Amazon and Flipkart Amazon plays favorites they have two or three companies that they keep pushing to the top they build their own Brands if a particular company is working well because they have data access go in DC democratizes that manufacturing has also been going crazy in the country because of four reasons the first one is friend showing and I love the use of the word because these people are VCS right they're Venture capitalists they will be careful about what they put in the deck but I don't have to be careful what they mean is India and the US are political allies U.S and China have been having trade War tensions and India is taking advantage of this in fact companies like apple now have a China plus one strategy but they're saying we don't want to be too dependent on China let's also get India as a partner in fact this year six percent of iPhone manufacturing happened in India this is a stark difference to zero many years ago but the rest is still in China and I feel that number is slowly going to shift towards India over the next few years the second thing is government incentives government is spurring manufacturing growth via the pli or the production linked incentive policy this was originally introduced by the it Ministry and as we know it has boomed incentives of four to six percent of production costs were given basis positive results the policy has now spread to 14 sectors with an expected investment outlay of 25 billion dollars the policy aims to create national manufacturing Champions 60 lakh jobs and production worth 375 billion dollars over the next five years and one of the reasons why manufacturing is going crazy in India is because it's actually cheap to manufacture things in India from a labor cost perspective we have one of the lowest labor costs in the world if you compare US to Singapore it costs you about 160 dollars per month to get a laborer in India that same laborer will cost you nearly five thousand dollars in Singapore and this is not a bad thing it doesn't mean we're underpaying these people it means that the cost of living in India is so low that these people still have the same type of Lifestyle as a person in Singapore making that kind of money it's like rental prices for a one bhk in New York now cost 50 to 60 lakhs per year that's because they're also making that kind of money so their lifestyle adjusted to the amount of money they're making is pretty much the same this low labor cost for a business when they're deciding to Outsource to Singapore or to India it makes us an obvious choice with a cheaper choice and as more and more deals come here we can slowly increase prices and finally lots of capital expenditures going in India that also seems to be returning in fact the capital cycle is turning which makes it a good time to be Manufacturing in India right now let's talk about narratives there are three very important articles and magazine covers put on this slide it's India's decade every week I go online there's somebody on Twitter saying it's India's decade India is going to be the future now there's one of two things either these American influencers and influencers across the world are doing this to farm engagement or they're doing it because they genuinely care about India the cool part is it doesn't matter because like I told you countries are stories they're very powerful stories and when people can hype up a country whether they're outside or inside doesn't matter that delusion can sometimes become real every great company you hear today once started as an idea as a story that enough people believed in and if too many people believe in it then that story Rises by itself because you have to take the money that comes out of the story and invest it in things like manufacturing that India has clearly shown it can do but we have been here before every 10 years there's a magazine cover that says this is India's year India will outpace China every year this happens these are optimistic people this is a political narrative it's a story about India you want to make it sound good you don't want to be a pessimist what's different this time is three specific things first is that we are improving public physical infra and digital infra things like UPI truly make India a treat to transactant versus places like Dubai where are struggling to pay for the simplest of things UPI has made payments frictionless and has increased the total number of peer-to-peer transaction in the country simply because of how easy it is same with physical infra the more you invest in manufacturing the better roads you have and the best proxy for this is what is your Highway length you can tell how a country is spending its money based on the length of Highway [Music] so and India's Highway land has gone from 70 000 kilometers to 151 000 kilometers in just a span of 10 years things like GST and digital welfare are making sure money comes back into the state for us to spend on the next cycle of projects finally teams that allow people to take loans are allowing us to be a more risk-taking Nation wish to always be very risk covers whereas China and the US are very risk-taking the individuals there are risk-taking because the government supports it that is coming to India the new industrial policy for example has been proposed for the first time after 1991 and it aims to boost access to finance for Rapid industrial growth all of this has led back to the central theme which has made India the fastest growing major economy in the world today like we've learned manufacturing is getting better exports and software are getting better and this is leading to a lot more consumers having a lot more liquid cash in their hands she spends for any random person are divided into Staples which are food and other expenses like that and discretionary spending which is should I buy a PlayStation or should I buy jewelry that's discretionary and it turns out India's discretionary spend has been increasing consistently which is a sign that either your Staples are getting cheaper to buy or that you're making more money and both of us know that Staples are not getting that cheap so people are making more money in this country in fact if you look at this graph and here's an exercise for you you can see that the average Indians spend on food in the last 10 years has been steadily decreasing what do you think is the reason for this something is making it cheaper you can go through this video you can scrub back and you can see I've already mentioned why I've already mentioned this change try and put two and two together why is Indians spend on food getting cheaper while food itself is getting more expensive tell me in the comments below I know we've been talking about India one two and three but let's talk about the Baseline and this is access to water supply in India today 99 of India has access to electricity that's a crazy feat even 2010 this was 76 we have successfully electrified our country but I promised you a narrative violation the story is too good to be true there's a lot of good parts in the story so what's the catch why is it more Capital flowing here why is everything slowed down well because there is a violation in the story a violation that we've already touched upon to a certain extent three main reasons the first one is the target addressable Market the number of people who can actually reach and sell your products to is not as large as we once thought outside of the top 30 million households in the country there is a steep drop in the propensity for that person to pay people just don't shell out money beyond the top 30 million households in the country there is a brutal power law which means that even though we have so many people a small handful do all the spending and you might not immediately realize why you might think well a very rich person is not going to eat that different of a food from a poor person maybe it's twice the price or Thrice the price how can it be so different well it's because of business if you're very rich and you own businesses those businesses will hire people those businesses will spend on things and many rich people own multiple businesses so through their entities they're hiring thousands of people and spending across many of those people so their spends and their contribution to GDP is not one or two or three times somebody who doesn't have money it's thousands even millions of times in some cases which means there is a power law the richest businessman would be okay if it's spending a billion dollars or two billion dollars on a deal but a poor person can't even fathom those numbers and finally there's a tapering of the frequent user base we think that apps are going to have certain number of users today three years later gonna have 10 times those number of users but it turns out you can hit this 30 million household very quickly after that that engaging user base tapers off one percent that is 15 million Indians pay any tax at all and the reason for this are not just because people are not making money is that we have a very high exemption rate the government has realized that if you tax somebody that's making like I said hundreds of thousands of millions of times of somebody that's poor it is better to focus on that person because that person will pay you so much tax versus wasting your time on people who don't have that kind of capital and are anyway going to hide their numbers what are you gonna do are you going to send the tax department to the house of somebody making three lakhs and take assets from them it's not worth the time or effort so Indian governments just like the smart startups are focusing on the power law and going after the top there's also one interesting stat here which that the income growth amongst the elite has been growing because the number of taxpayers there has also increased very sharply nitin kamath who is the co-founder of zerotha recently set out to estimate the potential paying users for b2c products and he said some things that will demoralize a lot of Founders which is what I said entrepreneurs have been wrong about India until we have finally learned about the market because the story sold to every VC is that today we have this many users tomorrow everyone in India is going to come online everyone's going to make money everyone's going to transact but that's the narrative violation you can get the user sure but will they transact unlikely nitin kamat says that the Indian market for b2c Tech businesses in terms of users probably 15 crores at Max he says that with fintech as a reference some data is available so he says that when people say India has 140 crore people and only 9 crore dmat accounts he says that but not all of these are unique the unique count is six crores many people have multiple accounts out of this active dmats withholdings above 10 000 Rupees is just three crores and this agrees with the mutual fund numbers they're about three and a half crore unique mutual fund holders in the country despite things like MF sahih which is this crazy campaign that was run despite all of that just three and a half crore people and he says that this could go to 15 crores Max but that's the upper ceiling three crores is what you can actually hit this is a much smaller number than most investors agree to when tiger rose called here when SoftBank was called when all the other investors were called here with the Bharat story that the transacting section of bharath is going to become bigger they're going to make more money it turns out that that's much harder to execute not because the founders are bad or stupid but because the power Lords in India are very skewed in fact Netflix has one of the lowest prices across geographies with less than 160 rupees per month per user and even they just have 6 million subscribers 6 million is a small amount for the amount of money that Netflix has spent in India and household goods ownership stats mirror online paying user stats in fact only 16 of households in India own all three of TV AC and washing machine look around you don't have to own the house even if you rent a house if you have these three things you are in the top 16 of this massive country and I'll tell you how strong this India Alpha power loss it is so strong that on zomato five percent of the user base makes up 33 of all orders place that is a massive amount for just five percent to cover in fact the product manager swiggy once told me that their app kept going in the background and he said it would go in the background come back go in the background come back and later on they found out what was happening is that the person the buyer was opening swiggy then checking the price of that same restaurant for the same product on zomato and then swiggy and zomato and swiggy and zomato and back and that's why the app was going in the background and this is for a product that's 30 to 40 rupees can you imagine India is very price conscious beyond that India one segment they're very price conscious beyond that on UPI which is Google paytm phone pay 6.5 of users are responsible for 44 of transactions nearly half of all transactions on UPI are made by just six and a half percent of users tiny number one percent of Indians account for nearly half the flights taken in this country one percent of Indians nearly half the flights can you imagine that math and one percent of Indians take home 22 of India's income and it seems we are nearing the limit of the paying potential of this country for now in fact all the revenue potential in e-commerce it's starting to hit a plateau much of the newer growth is going to to come from rural households which is India 2 and India 3 mostly India 3 who don't have that higher paying potential so even if they buy they will buy smaller ticket items they'll buy products worth 100 rupees or 50 rupees instead of spending the average 500 rupees but those three steroid shots that made us buff as a country are now waning the effect is wearing off it's weakening and I don't think we are going to find another jio or a covet anytime soon that is suddenly going to add new transacting users to apps and businesses out there I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon in fact the estimate of acquiring a new online shopping household is between 5000 Rupees to 12 000 rupees so for acquiring 30 million new households there'll be anywhere from 1.8 billion at the lower end to 4.5 billion dollars at the upper end to acquire 60 million households is nearly 10 billion dollars of spend which is just not worth it because you're not going to make that money back they don't have the paying potential for that money so most companies are saying let's focus on that 10 years later data once they've improved and the next slide says that because these steroid shots are waning off the number of transacting users on apps like zomato have plateaued they've flattened the graph is flattened it's not no longer like this it's straight in fact the top four it firms are now laying off people after so many many years it is going to be a tough one or two years for everyone in business in fact the Jeffries report put out a statement saying that they think that the staple industry believes rural has bottomed out but there's no conclusive evidence of pickup as of yet we prefer Staples over discretionary we prefer things like the essentials rather than a new PlayStation or a car but the cool part is India and Indus Valley which is the business ecosystem of India is learning through every generation what I'm telling you now I wish somebody came to me 10 years ago and just told me but we didn't have this I didn't have somebody picking out a report like this and conveying it to me in simple terms I didn't have Twitter where I could go and see what people are thinking what people are learning live we now have that and we can make the next gen generation better because we can learn from each other through sites like Twitter through videos like this on YouTube this is what is going to push us forward as a business Nation now Venture Capital which is outside funding has been a great driver for wealth in companies many of the senior Talent who's worked there for three or four years have been able to cash out because when investors come in they want a certain stake in the company and they're willing to give Founders and ex-employe's whole stock a little bit of money at a discount to be able to get those shares at a slightly cheaper price but that is slowing down in fact I'm an entrepreneur I've been in the ecosystem for about 10 years and I can tell you that it might be a very risky time to start or even join a startup funding is going to be dry over the next one or two years everybody believes that investors are not deploying Capital because IPOs have slowed down if there's no liquidity if an investor can't foresee him making money out of retail investors later he's not going to put in money now so it's going to be dry in fact now is the best time to work in a startup because the efforts that you put now will give you ESOP all the tourists by now are gone all the people continue to to stay in here are people who want to run or work in startup and if you join a startup now three years later your esops would have vested and matured and when the next Bull cycle comes you'll be the person getting rich if you make the BET today however let me warn you it is still a risky bet and all these startups have increased the size of the organic labor pool in 2017 I started writing a book called pajama profit where I said that the future of India is going to be the gig economy future people laughed at people said remote work design jobs gig working driving a cab for people in the morning and then doing coding at night no chance but it turns out that I was right and this is the best part about social media and three years later you can see whether you were right or wrong and with pajama profit I was right gig work in India has gone from 1.4 million people to nearly 4 million people it's been up and to the right more people are doing two three four gigs a day and I think that's the future we call it Moonlighting everyone has multiple interests we have all these Computing tools we don't need to to put an extreme amount of manual labor in what we're doing anymore to produce output so we have free time per day why not use it to make a little bit of extra income which is what people are waking up to in the country and startups will become much more visible like with the IPL lots of startups have sponsored the IPL and they're doing it to build trust I've said this before but India is an underbranded Nation we have lots of products but we don't trust these small small products that are sold at stores unless there's a brand behind them there's a reason we buy Tata salt and Tata Nano and Tata steel We Trust startup so all these startups are trying to generate trust and spending on the IPL is yet another way of them trying to win your trust and if I show you these logos on screen whether you hate them or you love them you recognize them and that's all they are playing for to be recognized so they can build more products for you in the future and it seems like the best companies to come out of the country are the ones that take advantage of some inflection point for example when aadhar came out lots of businesses became successful out of it zeroda was actually a huge beneficiary of of other UPI gave paytm and phone pay a big boost to the point where something like paytm now has many many more users than something like ICICI Bank and 2022 was a great year for electric vehicles so if you're working in electric vehicles continue working at it because we have crossed 1 million sales of electric vehicles last year just look at this graph and the other half that is online has a very interesting Dynamic 10 of Nika's Revenue comes from online ads that they show on their platform it's the same with Flipkart and Amazon it turns out that most people are sitting on these platforms these e-commerce platforms and just scrolling and somebody's paying to show an ad of a lipstick and it turns out that is more relevant than you getting an ad for lipstick on a WhatsApp or any random platform where there's no connection to what you're doing so e-commerce companies are also becoming advertisement platforms so it turns out where people are ready to do Commerce it's a good place for you to run ads and I also think that's gonna happen in video in fact 10 percent of content consumed in India right now is short form video content which is now contributed into one percent of digital ad spends and that's only going to increase the next slide has a tweet by Kunal Shah there's a quote tweet by this dude called varunmaya that shows the interesting part about Clubhouse see all these apps in the US they raise money and obviously they have consumers and obviously they have users and some percentage of those users can be monetized but then they go to those investors and say now we are expanding to India it's the same scene with Netflix they say we're going to expand to India all these views are going to join us our daily active users and weekly active users and monthly active users are going to explode and therefore we're going to make so much money and what this deck has taught us it's very easy to get those users but it is very hard to monetize them India is called the Dau Farm of the world which is daily active use of farm in the world for a reason you get lots of users they simply don't pay in fact one of the ways to make users pay is through gaming and here's a very important thing for you to note when VCS talk about gaming they're usually talking about real money gaming try the gambling gifting things like that it's not valorant they're not talking about valorent or Age of Empires right so it's a different form of gaming and this seems to make a lot of money in fact I know a very popular fantasy sports app that says that we are here for the love of sport and cricket and whatnot but 99 of their revenue comes from rummy and poker it seems like one interesting way to monetize the Indian audience it's just questionable what they're up to and even the older generation of Indian companies are now going online Hindustan Unilever Mahindra many of the others many of these old companies are also starting YouTube channels when I started my YouTube channel they said why is this founder sitting and doing YouTube what's the purpose but now we have these old Enterprise companies doing it because attention is the new oil especially relevant attention not just have a social media app and have lots of user element ad running all over the place on it it is relevance if you start a channel for gardening then you can sell gardening things it's just obvious and all these old school companies are going online because they realize it's a very powerful acquisition Channel and all of the e-commerce players that are still making money through ad Revenue like I said 10 of Nike's Revenue comes from their ad Revenue but despite of that they are launching their private label Brands they're saying we have this distribution we have all this data what they want why not just start our own label like Amazon has Amazon Basics it's learning from the data of all the people that are selling on Amazon then creating its copy brand and putting that at the top of listings and India is not very happy with this we are building out our own e-commerce in frog in ondc and now something called gem that allows us to give people a platform without this manipulation by these large players one interesting Insight I saw from this deck was that tier 2 and tier 3 India shop with voice this was very insightful for me in fact 5x was the year-on-year growth in voice search users two in three users of voice search are from tier 3 in smaller cities and they're making these voice search in their Regional languages 40 of voice search users search for fashion and one in two of these Regional voice search users are first time Shoppers so if you want to expand you have to go Regional I want to end this video with one last thing okay we talk about apps and daily active users and all these Mega numbers with people on their phones but guess what paytm launched a sound box a physical product because India is a low trust society and Merchants don't trust that somebody's made a payment so paytm lost a sound box which is now selling 1 million units a month so for all the things we can say about online India still buys products it can physically touch and feel and that is very telling of the Indian story what I've learned is that India will not pay for the greatest of software online but they're willing to pay 125 rupees a month for a physical sound box which can obviously also happen through the phone but these people still want a physical sound box that says you have received 40 rupees from Rahul can you imagine that

{"video_id": "WQbr_68Gt6k", "title": "What Is Really Real?", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQbr_68Gt6k", "transcript": "i've been thinking about the concept of a shadow you have let's say a solid mass and you have a light source the mass is going to cast a shadow like this the shadow has many of the characteristics of that solid mass the same thing is happening with screens in the 1990s if you saw some sort of content on a monitor right connected to a pc if you wanted to transfer that content you needed a floppy disk or a cd-rom drive right to pull it out from that computer and put on the next computer or the next device but today it's very different it's sort of like the computer is just a screen it's just emitting information that's not even on the pc that information is now on the cloud and it follows you around consistently like a shadow from the pc to your mobile phone to your pc similarly your personality on these digital platforms is different depending on different circumstances in a decade it's almost like you'll have the power of wizardry either through glasses or through lenses you will be able to project information on any surface instead of you having a mobile phone you are now going to be able to just project information onto the back of your wrist like those sci-fi movies instead of you having a very powerful pc that pc is going to live in the cloud and stream information to your glasses right it's just going to be visual information it's just going to be very powerful internet you're going to be under the influence of wi-fi all the time right and you are going to be able to just draw out the power that's sitting in the cloud one of the first companies that actually proved this was possible was stadia which is the gaming platform right where instead of you having to download the game they live stream the game to you so whenever you move left on the controller it is sending that information across to the internet and on that pc that lives in the cloud that character is moving left we basically just get windows into the world and our identity traverses with us everywhere no gaps not even for the bathroom i know your phone kind of still makes it to the bathroom but not even for the bathroom not only there's a secondary effect of having something in our visual periphery all the time the question i want to ask you is what is going to be in your visual periphery my belief is that it's going to be something that's very consistent among many people that are wearing the same device what i mean by that is your twitter profile is probably going to show let's say a thousand followers now if i open it it's also going to show me a thousand followers it's sort of like there's a database that's keeping track of this information and both of us see that same information that can be taken forward a notch just like pokemon go you could see a pikachu in front of you right and if i was playing the same game i would also see a pikachu in the same area which is what pokemon go did and became very very famous for the implication of that is that we start believing things that are not truly real let me explain what this means let's say you and i both agree that i have 100 000 followers on let's say youtube but in reality there is no such thing as 100 000 followers it's just that on youtube's platform in their database it says varun maya 100 000 you and i both see it so it becomes real to us right we after the invention of the internet and screens have stopped being able to differentiate what is real and what is fake in fact i would go one step further and i would say that there is no such thing as real and fake if we all believe in something it becomes real like the concept of money money is not real but since we all believe in it since that shopkeeper down the road will take your five rupees it becomes real to him it becomes real to you it becomes a utility similarly that is now going to extend to pokemon right it is now going to expand to so many other things outside of pokemon and that is where i believe that ar will have the maximum impact on our lives far more than we are like just imagine you and your friends have probably played age of empires online imagine being able to do that on a top where i have these glasses on you have these glasses on we're both seeing the same thing we're both seeing age of empires happen in the real world in real time and i can move my character you can see that character being moved in real time you can react accordingly immediately any flat surface right and i'm telling you just like the world has adapted for computers and mobile phones with charging points and stuff across the world flat surfaces are going to become more common as we want space to start projecting so that people can do multiplayer things with each other if me and my wife want to watch a movie instead of us turning on the tv we're just gonna have a flat space but we project information and we're both seeing the same information at the same time so having that sort of power in your eyes changes the burden of entertainment from your monitor and your television and your fire stick to pure software now i know you guys have seen the toy version of ar you've seen the version of ar where you put up your phone and you can see like a lion that is not what i'm talking about it has the elements of it it's like a toy camera which we used to use when we were young but it will evolve into something much much much better in real time now ar has been overshadowed by its cousin virtual reality the problem with virtual reality after having used it for many many years is that virtual reality has a retention problem people use it once people use it twice people use it for five times and then they stop they just put in their cupboard and never see it again and the problem is that having a big device stuck to your face all the time that requires charging every two hours is simply too painful and that's why i believe that in 10 years ar is going to dwarf vr but not ar on the phone and this is why every company from microsoft to google to facebook are all working on ar headsets that are light and portable and that are able to do everything i just told you goldman sachs in fact projected that ar and vr by 2025 will make 80 billion dollars in revenue it's going to be a steep curve in nowhere close to 80 billion dollars in revenue for these two technology facebook which is now meta actually believes that vr and ar is going to play a very very big part of their revenues and facebook is historically not a company that's cared too much about revenue since 2019 ar sales have been climbing like crazy unlike smartphones ar is creeping up on us the reason for this is because unlike smartphones the initial customer base for ar is going to be businesses instead of you buying a thousand monitors it's easier for you to buy glasses for your team members and tell them hey you know take it on the go remote work you want to go to taiwan and work go do it you want to go to bali and work you can do that just carry these glasses along and the information the data is going to be here in our database which will be streamed to you over wi-fi over the internet and just like the internet and computers we won't even know when our life changed or adapted because of ar it's just going to be one of those things that happened now i want to talk a little bit about the opportunity here one of the first investors that ever invested in me once told me something very interesting he told me that every big business massive businesses are built on some cultural or technological change instagram and whatsapp didn't become big because you know photo sharing was a new thing or a chat was a new thing they became big because they roared on the court tales of smartphones when the smartphone came out the first company to ever come out with a task manager for the smartphone is today making hundred million dollars in annual revenue new platform new opportunities so i believe that in the ar space there's going to be plenty of opportunities some of them are already taken for example it would be hard for you to make a video streaming service in ar because hey youtube is already the giant there but in many other segments for example shared excel sheets because excel doesn't have really powerful 3d capabilities yet you can build that technology first right and so millions of business customers because i feel ar is really going to kick start with business but as vrs has kick-started with games and i feel like whenever you do something for business you make money and whenever people make money and industry gets formed to get into this space i recommend the unreal engine now unreal engine is a platform that i've been using for a very long time at this point i've been a game developer since i was the age of 13 and unreal engine makes it very easy to get into actually building ar and vr technology in fact i even taught a cohort on unreal engine and many of those students got placed in companies like bombay player now lately i haven't really had the time to actually do a cohort by myself and i'm a really big long-term believer in ar vr and the metaverse right i don't like using the word metaverse but i'm a really big believer in this and one of the companies that i spoke to very recently that has actually built their own ar glasses is actually running a cohort very similar to mine where they're actually teaching people unreal engine among a suite of other technology they are actually one of the few companies that have actually built out a mixed reality headset given it out to many creators under the ajna creator program now i really respect people who both build the technology as well as build the software to run that technology now arjuna is one of the few companies that have actually built out a mixed reality headset and is now creating a set of courses to actually learn more and build software for that headset like i told you they figure out the technology part now it's time for the software so you can take advantage when 2025 or 2030 comes about starting with ar vr nfts blockchain and even digital twin technologies something that i actually did in the past arjuna is taking you through the whole hog of what it means to build for that reality that's coming in 2030 using the unreal engine which is something that i fall in love with a long time ago now the people who know me know that anyone who's doing stuff in unreal engine in india i have a soft spot in my heart for them right and when i spoke to the team when i looked at what they're building when i looked at hardware infra i was like these people know what they're doing right and it's rare for me to say that about this space now i asked them if this is only for computer science graduates or if anyone can join and according to them absolutely anyone can join you don't need a coding degree you don't need any sort of coding experience and by the end of it you get complete support either for a job or to go out and start your own ar vr business the first batch is starting on the 15th of august and for tracking purposes go use my code varun 50 to get 50 off on that batch the link is in the description if you want to know more about this now one very interesting or important point for me to put here is i want to tell you why they have skin in the game firstly because they are one of the only xr hardware oems to actually build ar vr glasses in india that itself is big credibility because nobody's doing it they were started all the way in 2014 at iit bombay with the idea to enable grassroots human performance for the next decade they built arvr technology for the indian navy for the army for drdo and bunch of other companies they've built ar based remote assistance they've built vr training simulators and they're also working with tata to build the world's largest metaverse for vocational training so definitely go give them a check out you know there's going to be a lush new playing field suddenly you're going to have this era where there is completely new hardware and zero software for that platform you need to be upskilled and you need to be ready for that platform and the tools for that decade are going to be unreal engine and unity and i'm excited for what you create for it it is empty land prepared to do war"}

is varun maya and i've been writing code for 17 years i started on a coding language called delphi that most people don't even remember today not only that i've been doing design starting with photoshop from 11 years i moved from photoshop to sketch to figma to even things like world creator but in all those years i have never once believed that ai will take over creative jobs i've been a non-believer but in the last two years in the light of incredible evidence i have changed my mind an artificially intelligent machine is becoming a bigger part of everyday life so in this video i'm going to tell you how powerful ai has become over the last two years why i am preparing myself and what you can do about it and how you can survive in an ai dominated future by the end of this video i'm also going to teach you where you can go and try this ai right now so that you can also see the evidence that i saw now if you don't believe me if you think there's something special and incredible about human creativity prepare for a shot just stay till the ending and then leave your comments now open ai released a new image generation technology called dally 2 that basically uses information from the entire internet to come up with new and novel images the first thing i did was to actually draw a picture of elon musk fighting the hulk now this looks like it was made by a real artist if you had told me in 2015 that this was made by ai i would have laughed at you next i asked dally to generate an oil painting of spiderman as you can see this is pretty good it's almost as good as an artist if not better i wouldn't be able to tell and i can guarantee you 99 of the population wouldn't be able to tell then i put up my display picture into delhi too and asked it to generate variants of me as you can see um all these people look very funny but most importantly they do not exist they are just variants of me that dali is creating in real time which one of us here finally i wondered whether dally can create logos i put up this lovely picture of a monkey logo that i had seen on dribble and asked it to create more variants so many awesome variants were created that i had to pick one up and put on a t-shirt just because of how good it looked you see i was going to contact the artist of the original design and ask him to make one more for me but ai has sort of taken that opportunity away and it is going to take the opportunity away from many such creative professionals now you might say well varun that was images what about text well let's get to text open ai was released a couple of years ago and i'm going to show you some examples in real time of how it answers certain questions for example i made open ai write an email to ankur variku asking for a job as you can see the ai understands that ankur works at nearby or worked at nearby and also understands that he's in the startup space this is a very well crafted email and better than 99 of the cold dms that i receive next i asked it to create a rap song created by batman or on behalf of batman and it came up with something spectacular these associations are something that ai has been picking up on for many years now there might still be some people in the audience that say pharaoh and music what about music music is so special well too bad openly i created something called the jukebox where it has original completely original tracks from any genre you want in fact music seems to be one of the easier things to replicate because it's not just open ai there are tools like eva that are able to generate tracks of any genre in fact the song or the background music for this particular video is made by ai not only that so is the thumbnail and also ninety percent of the script i only need to add in the data and the figures and the research i put up a real very recently about how ai is going to take over creative jobs first creative jobs are going to go and a lot of people replied on that saying this idiot does not understand creativity creativity is special well let me tell you a little bit about me i was a bloomsbury published author in fact we wrote a bestseller called pajama prophet that predicted remote work three years before it happened next i was actually the youngest entrepreneur in india to raise money for a visual job platform we took nakri.com and made it very visual this was unique at the time being a software engineer and a designer i've also made games games that many people have played and many people have enjoyed one of my favorite ones is something called mumbai make hatsa where i tell the horror story of a woman going through her life in mumbai after death i also replicated myself as a 3d virtual avatar many years before unreal launched metahuman next i even put up a trailer one entire year before facebook did about the word methods talking about how the future is going to be a metaverse one year before facebook rebranded to meta in fact i even named my company meta thinking that that is the future now i'm not telling you all of this to brag i'm telling you all this because i'm not just some random youtuber i have been creative i continue to be creative and i am scared of ai and so should you i have the humility to say that this is going to replace many functions of my job in the next few years i wonder why 16 year olds on youtube do not believe the same thing now some people will still harp on creativity and say no varun creativity human special shut up you have no idea what creativity is you have a sense of what creativity is you think it comes from the sky scientists have been studying creativity for 20 years there are full peer-reviewed research papers on creativity there are studies of how creativity works and it turns out that ai just replicates those same things so what i want to do right now is talk about creativity i want to break it open for you and show you how it happens so let's assume there are two kinds of digital jobs that humans can do one are bounded jobs and the other are unbounded bounded jobs mean that there is a skill cap there is a ceiling there's a score to the job it has unbounded well there's no way to keep a score you can't compare my videos to let's say somebody else's video right because we'll all have our different styles we'll all do it in different ways now over the last few years we've all known that ai has been replacing bounded jobs right if it's detecting cancer ai's been doing a better job well the future of diagnosing breast cancer may be in the hands of artificial intelligence if it's about protein folding ai has solved the 50 year old grand challenge of protein folding ai has already beaten the world champions at go it has already beaten the world champions at chess and has also played really well at dota in fact dota was one of the first few demonstrations of ai where when i watched the match i saw and i realized that this is the future because dota is not really a bounded game there's a lot of creativity in how you play and there are so many different variables because each character in dota has four skills and there are hundreds of characters so lots of permutations and combinations and ai was doing that very well but forget about bounded jobs that's not where creativity comes in let's talk about the unbounded ones chatting with people creating paintings creating music right these are things you can't really easily compare to humans but when you look at something nice it evokes an emotion inside you how the hell is ai supposed to compete with that well i never believed that ai could take over unbounded jobs but in 2019 nvidia put out this beautiful song [Music] the song was so inspiring and emotional i wondered how is it that a machine created this and then i got the answer that the machine was indeed using existing music from real people and mashing it together in ways we do not understand it turns out that real creativity in the human brain works exactly the same way and now i am going to reveal the formula for creativity it is to take an object and to place that object into a completely alien surrounding is to take things from different domains and mash them together to make something brand new like taking maggie and putting it into milk most of the time real human creativity produces rubbish but sometimes it revolutionizes the world take the example of the beatles until then it was always unknown that most rock and roll artists mostly used rock and roll but the beatles had very special music their music wasn't confined to a single or maybe two genres it was more diverse and versatile they started with rock and roll then they stretched it to folk psychedelic indie ballads they mixed and matched and created new things the fact that they chose to include sitar in the song love you too within you without you and sound of moving tapes in tomorrow never knows showed that they truly understood creativity take the example of boxing one of the greatest boxers in the ring muhammad ali was once known for his very special style called the shuffle muhammad ali was such a creative boxer that he took something from dance and brought it into the art of boxing what he did not only confused his opponents it also created a new style that was unpredictable to a defender next take the example of the monster godzilla [Music] to make the roar of the animal people took the sound of rusty car doors and metal rubbing against each other i know we're getting deep into examples but take the example of francis crick and watson who actually came up with the structure of dna watson claimed that he had a dream where he saw snakes entangled over each other now imagine if watson didn't have exposure to snakes or never saw those snakes he would never have come up with the idea you need to have that substrate that baseline to mash together this is why tech companies are considered so innovative because they take something that already exists in the real world and add computer science to it zomato is just restaurants digitized airbnb is hotels and stays digitized so on and so forth this is what makes them innovative because they're mashing two weird domains that have not been matched before everything you have ever done is either the same or a variant of something your parents or your environment has done in the past in other words creativity is the brain's ability to remix different elements let's call these elements substrates but it cannot use elements or substrates it doesn't know for example you can't think of a new color a blind person a blind from birth person will never see visuals in their dreams dreams are of course the original remix machine when i dream i i don't see anything because my subconscious doesn't know how to see therefore i can't see in my dreams right see christine remembers what it's like to see in her brain but for me i don't so i i dream of my other four senses i can smell taste touch and hear in my dreams but i don't see anything that's the thing about creativity you me bach beethoven everyone else who you know who you think is creative has never created anything original in their life it has always been mashups and that's why there's the quote steal like an artist because we don't know what substrate they used because they mashed it up beyond recognition now some of you might think this all happened after the invention of the internet artists before the internet were creative in fact dragon ball is a mashup of sun wookong and superman even the original artists claim so now i will tell you something even further that's going to blow your brains sun wukong himself is not an original character his inspiration comes from an amalgam of indian and chinese culture the monkey king was possibly influenced by the hindu deity hanuman which is the monkey god as we all know from the ramayana this is because there were stories of the monkey god hanuman that were passed to buddhist travelers who traveled to china via india the monkey king's origin story includes the wind blowing on a stone whereas hanuman is the son of the god of wind it absolutely blows my brains that a character like goku an anime character that i grew up watching can be a re-rendition of hanuman who i've read about since i was even younger and a lot of us still believe in the myth that creativity exists in the right brain that is absolutely false all the creativity researchers will go on record telling you that creativity stems from multiple parts of the brain working in unison studies of children in particular show that watching something else creative viewing a fantasy film an unstructured play encourages new insights analytical thinking and creativity the more that children are exposed to novel situations the more creative they become later in life basically you are giving them substrates that they can remix and mash up later in life exposure to something and the ability to remix are all that's required for creativity and that is exactly what ai does in the case of dali it is a remix machine but like the human brain understands the relationships between things it knows the relationship between astronaut and person and between person and riding and between riding and horse even though the word person isn't mentioned in this query the ai has a relationship mapped so it knows it should show the astronaut with his legs folded on top of the horse now you might think what about the actors in the picture varun what about the words well the ai also has a map of pixel to pixel relationships the transformer in dali is what allows the model to generate new images that accurately fit within a given text prompt it learns how language and images fit together so that when you ask the model please give me an arm chair in the shape of an avocado it is able to spit out some super creative designs that you have never thought of or seen before the link between textual semantics and their visual representations is learnt by another open ai model called clip which stands for contrastive language image pre-training clip is trained on hundreds of millions of images in their associated captions far more exposure than the human brain has so essentially dali is taking content and remixing it exactly the same way you and i would do except it has far more data now if you look at daly one you'll see that many of the images it put out were garbage but dali 2 is so much better i am afraid of what comes next beyond just creative and accurate designs the transformer in dali also seems to understand some common sense physics for example you could ask it for an illustration of a baby panda wearing headphones staring at a reflection in its mirror and it will create this all the way down to the details of the mirror's reflection now don't get me wrong ai doesn't understand what's going on dally doesn't understand what a horse is a human is it just understands the relationship between these two things and is able to come up with creative output most scientists believe that the human brain uses similar software but with different hardware your brain has an encoder that maps various visual objects in your memory you know what my face is like because you're seeing it right now and you've committed it to memory if you subscribe you'll see my face even more often now if you go into a garden your brain is not randomly going to start putting my face over all the trees it doesn't do that because your brain knows how to maintain context however when you go to sleep or when you're on psychedelic drugs the brain context machine actually breaks down whatever you are thinking of unconsciously gets pasted onto your surroundings what you just saw looks almost exactly like what google deep dream does the images that google deep dream produces look almost exactly like hallucinatory or psychedelic experiences of human beings where that context part of the transcoder disappears now let's get back to creative jobs look the top one percent of jobs are never going anywhere if you're the top one percent musician you're probably going to use ai it's gonna make your life easier if you're a top one percent youtuber you'll make youtube videos but you might use ai to generate thumbnails right so you're not going anywhere my worry is with the 99 of india that is not that good when i saw openai create a cold email to varico i have seen that versus the cold emails i get i feel sad and scared for this country because ai is easily able to mash up all this data it can beat out thumbnail designers average musicians average video creators and so on and so forth because i've seen the jump from daly one to dally two i know how much is at stake when a daly three comes out now enough scare mongering right here are the three things you can do to actually beat out ai number one learn and master english i know a lot of indians are allergic to english we always say hey why should we learn english you know regional languages are better that may be true but opportunities and ai has been trained on the english language the captions that we're fed to daily to are all in english if you master english then you have the ability to create anything that creativity can be in your hands so the people who can speak well are going to be able to control the future more importantly open eye uses a technology called lossless compression if you give it two words and say spiderman script it might give you many pages of a script because it can keep producing based on you know hundreds of thousands of or millions of content pieces it already has but if you write more words if you give it more specificity you can mold the output it's like a clay pot right when it's spinning you can touch it in different areas to make it exactly the part you want otherwise it will create something of its own will so the better you know english the more context you are able to give it the next thing you can do and this is much harder to do is to gain some sort of distribution or trust ai cannot create a youtube channel tomorrow and have hundreds of thousands of views the attention of the audience is not something that ai has right now so if you made a youtube channel or you wrote a blog or you had a twitter page we had even two thousand or 3000 people listening to you that is distribution or trust that ai will have a hard time gaining in fact once you have that distribution of that trust you can use ai to create as many products as you want combined with the entire no code wave that's going on on the other side you can be an entrepreneur with a fraction of the cost of what it costs today to run a business and hire engineers and designers finally you could also just choose a job where ai just doesn't have enough training data but this is i feel a race where you're trying to race and you know somebody's constantly feeding training data because unfortunately the internet has so much data it's hard to compete in fact real world jobs are a much safer bet than digital jobs and this is against what naval said in fact yes i am taking a counter stance to what naval said because in the light of extreme evidence you must be able to change your mind now i know nobody in this country is talking about this we're talking about politics we're talking about sports we're talking about all sorts of rubbish nobody is talking about how ai is going to come and wipe away so many jobs that most of the white collar workforce does today that's 18.1 million people that make up most of our economy whose jobs or most of whose jobs are going to be wiped out in less than a decade we're not talking about this which is why i'm going to work very hard to give you that escape velocity i cannot guarantee you will have a job forever i cannot guarantee that what you do will work forever but i can help you out smart and out speed ai in the time being follow me on my youtube and i'm going to keep telling you the jobs the careers the skills the mindset to have to outpace this thread that's just around the corner now if you want to try out the text version of open ai for yourself go to this website login or create an account and start creating dali 2 which is the image generator which i feel will have far more of an impact on your life is going to be out soon to the general public i got access a little earlier but when that's out make sure you try it and if you follow this channel obviously you will learn more about this space and how to uh how to still succeed in this crazy world that's about to come [Music]"}

{"video_id": "CEX0dPo0otw", "title": "10 Life Lessons I Learned The HARD Way!", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEX0dPo0otw", "transcript": "in this video i want to tell you 10 learnings that i had written down in a diary about a year and a half ago yesterday i was looking at what i'd written and i realized hey none of this is too bad to be said on camera so maybe i should go and tell my audience all the things that i'd learned from my life so this video is going to be 10 life tips from varun maya's life so before i get to the tips i want to tell you that this is not all just business stuff some of it is but it's mostly life stuff it's mostly personal stuff things i've learned in my personal life tip one make sure you brush your teeth twice a day and also make sure you floss now i'm sure you heard this advice like a million times from your dentist you probably heard it from your parents you've probably seen it on tv but i've actually learned it the hard way so genetically my family and i have very crisscross teeth right one tooth in the front one tooth and back so the problem with that is that food particles can get stuck in between the teeth because of course they're in weird crisscross shapes and the problem with that is that big bad bacteria can come and start chewing on that food while they're chewing on the food they also start eating through your teeth for the first few years of my life i really didn't care right um i didn't brush my teeth too often when i went to hostel i used to brush my teeth once a day maybe one and a half times a day but that caught up to me and i started having a lot of cavities uh i had to have like almost four root canals so it's not the most fun place to be luckily when you get your tooth root canal it's like a permanent crown that they put on you can't tell the difference between a real tooth and a fake tooth um but yeah i wish i'd been more regular brushing my teeth and because of the shape of my teeth i also had to floss which i completely forgot over the last year i've been brushing and flossing every single day twice a day flossing you know just before i head to bed and my teeth have been better than they ever have right so it's just a life tip take it how you want to if you have crisscross teeth like me make sure you hit the brush the next thing is don't hold on to your opinions too dearly see i had a video about entrepreneurs and arrogance see when you're young it is good for an entrepreneur to be arrogant because if you're not arrogant you'll just be underconfident and it is so tough that you need that extra confidence that comes from the arrogance to go tackle whatever you're tackling but one problem with being arrogant especially when you're young is that you hold on to your opinions too dearly you believe in something and it could be half baked you might not like really understand it but you're like i get it and i'm gonna hold on to this dearly don't do that because when you've lived as long as i have in startup land or just general in life for the last 10 years and done as many things as i have sometimes your opinions will end up being wrong even if you're damn sure of them be a student of the world we're not here to make ultimatum decisions right the world decides nature decides and we have plain passerbys right we have a little bit of control over our environment but we do not decide the outcome of events so don't hold on to your opinions dually be easy going the next thing is to understand the underlying currents of other people's emotions see when i'm having a conversation with people these days i not only listen to what they're telling me the substance i'm also trying to listen to what's the emotional undercurrent for example sometimes when i fight with my wife she might be complaining about groceries but the underlying current could be the fact that you know she's frustrated at work or she's angry with me because i left the geezer on right so i've noticed that what a person says and what they're really meaning can be two different things right and it's true even at work so an employee could come and tell me we really need to do this this is a great idea but the underlying current could be the fact that he might have told another employee that you know i think this will work and he's trying to get that agenda pushed so i always listen with two years we've got two years the first year is to listen for the actual substance the other year is to try and understand the emotional undercurrent the minute you can put one and two together not only can you make better decisions you also become a much more empathetic human being right you let things slide because you know where it's coming from the next thing is that i've realized over the years that people are a product of their circumstances there's a saying right past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior i've actually seen that to be true many times if a person is a certain way in a particular year there's a very high likelihood unless they have crazy awareness that they're going to be exactly the same four years later they might be doing something different but their personality doesn't change much the way they behave doesn't change much and we've learned this with a lot of things including with integrity with some of our employees we've learned this with work ethic we've learned this with you know just everything basically if you're with somebody who's like super toxic don't expect that person to change right you can't save that person if you're with somebody that's optimistic don't expect that person to change four years later so that's why it's more viable for you to be with somebody that's optimistic rather than constantly pessimistic because the optimist is always going to be like that right and your days are going to be better if you're with a pessimist or a toxic person you spend so much energy just dealing with that person waste of time the next thing i've learned is to choose your life partner wisely if done right and i think i got it right it can change who you are and what you're capable of life gets tough right and i've been through my share of tough instances right both with work with health with a bunch of things and my partner has always been there with me right i know india now has gotten this be single revolution and that's fine right if it works for you but if you can get a great life partner life gets easier and dude we're put here in a very very tough land right just dropped here from the sky into a very tough place why not do it with companionship the next thing i've learned is that nobody's truly there for you apart from your family and a few friends and a few well-wishers and it's very hard to tell who's a good well-wisher and who's a who's somebody who will not be a well-wisher two years later so it takes a lot of effort to surround yourself with good people and i've realized as i age that i've lost so many friends and that's because i've gained a very solid core set of friends and family and i don't need any more it's always a give and take relationship i always keep my circle tight and i keep all favors i ask from outside measured the next thing actually comes from taleb book skin in the game and i've seen this throughout right if somebody's giving you advice maybe it's your mentor maybe it's your teacher maybe it's your parents if they don't bear the brunt of that advice if it goes wrong then don't take that advice from them like i've seen a lot of people right who give gyan who go on the internet and say and including me right on this youtube channel right now i could give you some gyan i could say don't do this or do this but tomorrow me or the other people are not going to bear responsibility for what happens so what is ideal is somebody who can take or share that responsibility with you so when shashank my co-founder tells me something i'm much more likely to listen and i'm more likely to dive in with him because both of us bear the brunt of those decisions if doesn't work both of us are responsible and i know he will help me pick it back up and he knows i will help him pick it back up right whereas if some random person on the street says oh you should do this with your startup i'm not going to listen whether startup succeeds or fails that person is just going to be on the road giving advice he or she is not going to pay the price for the outcome of that decision this is the reason i distrust wealth managers this is the reason i distrust people who give random health advice on the internet this is the reason i distrust people who give random financial advice and so on and so forth right and you could also put me and my youtube channel in this category so that's why i always tell people right and even i think siddhartha gautam buddha also said this if i say something that you don't agree with or that i don't fully bear the consequences of listen to it but eventually take your own decision right use me as a factor in your decision making but don't let me make the decisions for you and it's not just limited to me right i think i'm one of the few people that actually has awareness of this right of the consequences of what i say but there are a bunch of influencers on the internet who don't bear those consequences so please listen to them but make your own decision at the end of the day they are not going to take the fall for your fall the next thing is make friends with yourself so i actually have a code name for the me inside right so i treat the me inside my head as a monkey right so i know there are two me's inside we've had conversations before sometimes it's always like i always tell myself hey why don't we figure it out i actually started calling him at least in the last few years i've started calling him v so i just say hey we will figure it out and i'm talking to myself sometimes i'm on the road walking just talking to myself i'm very sure people think i'm crazy right but i have such a good rapper with myself we've been through hell together obviously uh and heaven together i've seen some people who know there's another person and i think all of you kind of know that there are two people inside you the relationship is very poor it's either toxic contradictory you don't trust the other person the other person doesn't trust you it's very weird right so what i say is build a rapper with each other which actually starts with accepting everything that's going wrong and everything that's going right i'm not going to go deep into it but i felt sick for a while and for a long time i didn't trust my internal me right we we were having conflict all the time but today we're in much better place because i accept i just accept everything that's gone wrong and everything that's gone right all the successes all the failures both personally and professionally just accept it build a relationship with yourself and that starts with radical acceptance it doesn't matter who you are it doesn't matter if you're fat thin etc etc don't worry about it build a rapper with yourself because you need your team to go take out the world the next thing and again this is personal advice you don't have to do this is learn to code bro i've had so many opportunities in life because i've learned to code and it's like you can see the difference right people who can code are 100 times you can just tell from salary range a senior quota today is like 50 lakhs to a crop marketeers with like four five years of experience don't make anywhere close to that amount there's huge demand if you're a coder you always have job security you in fact are more likely to go out and raise capital because vcs know that investing money in somebody who is engineering heavy means there's good return out of it right because it is a product people can use a product only engineers can make products so coding whether you're making a physical product or a digital product coding is still necessary today right even for physical products unless you're selling a house which you know is a very different kind of engineering so yeah learn to code low cost very very high outcome and opportunity and purely skill based you don't need to like a factory or a house you don't need to put in you know few crores to make a few more crores you can put in zero and make a lot of money out of it and there's also something really magical about being able to talk to machines look i'm communicating with you right now i'm speaking english i could speak hindi i could speak kannada and i could communicate with you why do you think it's different with machines i want this beautiful computing device with all the power inside it i want that for me i want to be a wizard i want to control it right i want to be able to give it instructions and i wanted to be able to understand right now you know how to give instruction if you can speak any language like hindi english karana whatever you already know how to give instructions right you can go outside and tell another person go straight and take a left you can do that right now all you have to do is learn another language learn a syntax to give those same instructions to a different device you're over hyping it in your head and you're seeing this battle going on on media with white hat junior and whatnot and that is misleading you to a certain extent right ignore the noise coding is about building a better future for yourself think about it you don't have to do it but think about it the last thing is build a network and keep it warm i've said this a million times now when you're young it's about what you know when you're old it's about who you know right so build a strong network people you can call and of course remember that not everyone's going to return your call not everyone's going to help you out in times of crisis but it doesn't hurt to build a network because if you have three people who can help you in a crisis maybe one of them will respond in a particular field in a particular context today i have so many people on speed dial on my phone who i can just call for any advice right all the way from marketing to sales to life to what should i do next should i raise capital to even which game should i download next so it's a beautiful thing to have a great network right don't underestimate the value of people you can still be an introvert you can still be in your own bubble i'm an introvert by the way on social media doesn't look like it but in real life i'm a very very very deep introvert but i still make it a point to try and maintain those relationships i keep my distance but you know i try to help them when they need help and i try to ask for help when i need help don't be a solo yellow type of person who doesn't ask anybody for help and doesn't have a network because you will be caught like a sitting duck especially when things get hard that's it for me bye [Music]"}

invest and i've never actually gone deeper into this this time and today i will so why invest money for many years of my life and i know this is going to sound crazy i have actually just let a big chunk of my money lie in my savings account for the first three or four years of my career i actually just did especially when i was freelancing i was so focused on freelancing and so focused on doing that well that i said i don't need to worry about what happens to the money sitting in the bank account i can just make more money and even today i believe that but i believe in also investing i believe it's not mutually exclusive but that time i had to focus i had to get better at the skill i didn't have too much free time on my hands and to be honest there weren't finance influencers back then to influence me to save now the main reason to convert money sitting in your savings account into some asset is because over the long run your wealth keeps getting eroded every year thanks to inflation your money is worth lesser and lesser and less over the last decade i've also learned that creating wealth is not just about making money it's also about saving and preserving that well so without much further ado this is how i invest my money now number one and this is going to be super controversial advice i actually leave a decent chunk of my money in fixed deposits now i know what you're thinking i know what you're thinking i know what you're thinking you might say fixed deposits borrowing they're stupid they don't work they have such a low rate of return you're insane sure but you guys have only seen a bull run for the last two years remember i've been around for almost a decade more than that in fact and i've seen my share of bull and bear runs and in times like that especially in times of recession instead of just leaving your money in hard cold cash it is better to put that money in an fd secondly and this is a nuance of how i save my money you might be comparing the stock market or any other asset with the fd i'm comparing the fd to just leaving that money in my savings account right the ft is almost always better now i know there might be some 18 19 year old traders who are going to talk about how they made 30 or 40 percent uh actually sitting down in day trading let me tell you one thing in a bull run everyone looks like a genius you can make three bad moves or ten bad moves and still end up making more money than usual because the stock market is just irrational less than one percent of traders will make more than bank fds this is a quote from nikhil kamath who runs zeroda which is one of the largest exchanges in india now these days i just cleared up any money that's sitting in my savings account just put in an fd or park into an fd quickly mainly because any excess cash that i have i will end up spending obviously secondly i might not always have time because i'm ceo and i run a business that is wildly profitable i should be focusing my time and energy there and on youtube where i'm building distribution in between these two and the number of people involved in both these enterprises it gets hard for me to immediately pick what stock i want to put money in because of this lack of time fds which provide a better return and the fact that free cash will erode at a much higher rate than fds i always clear them and put them into fds even though a lot of people believe this is not good advice it is good advice for me and i've seen it work well over the last few years except maybe in the last one or two years when there's been a bull run where obviously the other assets are better and i will also tell you how i invest in the other assets so it's not that if i do fds i do only fds i have a diversified portfolio i put money in fds and i also put money in other assets now you're right for a long term investor like me in a good market fds have not that great return so what i do in good markets is to try and shift money out of the fds that's why i have low terms i try to shift that money over the stock market and the way i do it is not to invest directly i do not have the time on a daily basis to be able to open my portfolio and see how much has gone up how much has gone down redistribute that money i'm not that kind of person right i prefer to build things that people love and make money when they love that thing and pay me for it so what i do is i actually invest through small case i think less like a trader and more like a long term investor i try to diversify my inputs and hope that one of the outcomes does well if not multiple if you've read the book psychology of money you'll realize that even though in moments instances when markets crash you might be bleeding and seeing red if you take a very long term horizon these are small instances but if you have paper hands and you sell as soon as you think the market's crashing and then you re-buy you're just wasting your time and also eroding wealth however if you play for the long term if you truly believed in the fundamentals of the business and the fact that the internet will one day boom then it's easier for you to stay with your money inside i believe it's a feature not a bug that i don't sit and like open my portfolio a thousand times a day and try to rejig what my portfolio is i'm more likely to buy near-term stocks rather than something i believe in the long term so the way i invest is that most of my investments are made through small case i diversify into stock debt and gold portfolios the instrument i use is small cases all weather investing it's a great instrument for me personally and it's an instrument with the least risk and still reasonably high rewards it performs great in all markets crash or no crash awi has you sorted and i like the fact that there are some people who are there at the moment even though i could be busy and not have the time to re shuffle my portfolio there are people there who are dedicated to make sure i don't lose money right they're trying their best to make sure hey this is crashing maybe we should shift it around maybe there's a macro economic trend that just makes gold useless tomorrow there are people that will see that data and move this around long term the product generates equity like returns for me while dramatically reducing volatility sort of has been a smooth well generation journey more importantly small case offers instant liquidity unlike fds which means that i can invest and redeem my money almost instantaneously i also started with small case fairly cheap it was much less expensive than alternatives and i began awi at a very low ticket and over the months and years grew confidence in its offering only then did i start shoving in more and more and more money small case has created an incredible algorithm that actually intelligently allocates funds to stocks gold and other assets it's been through its battles ups and downs and i kind of trusted at this point which is why i'm just going to leave my money there now as always do your own research in this video i want to talk about how i invest my money but do your own research before use any product and make sure you've put some thought into where you're parking your capital so finally a little less than 10 of my asset pool is crypto now i know what that looks like it's like hey varun you've done very safe you've done safe and then you've done the crazy right like crypto uh for a long time i didn't even invest in like bitcoin or ethereum even though i have exposure to both uh i was just all over the place right i was like i'll try this nft i'll do this i'll do this crazy project i'll see how this goes um but over the years i've learned that crypto hasn't been wrong for that long at least bull run of crypto hasn't been along for that long i've been invested in crypto since 2014 and at this point i just have an sip in bitcoin and ethereum i invest a little bit every month and i just believe in the long-term fundamentals it's the same thing i told you with regards to amazon right like if you truly believe in the fundamentals of something and are willing to wait a very long time then you should by all means just keep putting your money there and not look at it again this is how i do it you should not do it this is obviously the riskiest asset class that's why all my money is not in there like for some reason kids these days are like either all your money goes there or all your money goes there you guys don't have that ability to say okay i will do a little bit of each it's crazy times but that's going to change soon now the reason i invested in a lot of nfts especially early on is to find out what that market's like to find out if there are technological advancements there to find out am i missing something a little bit of fomo as well but at this point i realized that at least in the early days there were some good projects today it's like mostly crap i just stay with the top two coins maybe i will move exposure to top three or four coins soon maybe i'm light at this point on the belief in utility of crypto but i do see their value as a payment processor and a value as a hedge to the dollar so i will continue to stay invested for very different reasons than other people invest in crypto which is to make 1000x their money i know this is going to sound strange but that's about it i will have some real estate exposure soon um but i guess you know it's not something that i'm going to be buying to be selling it's a house like i want to make sure i have a house so that i can stay there for a long long long time i'm always long term on these things where i think shorter term is my approach to projects my approach to actually building cool stuff but with finances i think longer term that's it for me bye [Music] you"}

found a bigger and a more successful scam in the history of the planet actually there are but law of attraction comes in the top few now this is going to trigger a lot of people right because many of you believe in the law of attraction with very small evidences to show for it i want to tell you why certain successful people believe in it and why there are a lot of unsuccessful people that still believe in it and have gotten nowhere find out this video see there are a lot of things i've really wanted and i would consider myself a persistent driven person so there are a lot of things i really really wanted and i haven't gotten right these are things that i've wanted with all my life and the things that i've not wanted but accidentally got it for example we didn't expect to get published by bloomsbury right when we wrote pajama profit it happened accidentally we didn't badly want it or anything and the things i really badly wanted which have just not come to fruition so point is life is random there's a book called fooled by randomness where a lot of people go through life in random sequences and then see some pattern it's like seeing you know cloud and saying oh this looks like an elephant they're seeing a pattern and they're assuming that pattern is the reality of life but truth is it's just random and sometimes life throws biscuits at you random biscuits at you and sometimes when you really wanted something and life is thrown a biscuit at the same time you associate the two you say i attracted this and life gave me this now some of you will send me a video of famous actors famous very famous actors in india saying law of attraction you know i attracted this and it came to me firstly guys actors are not hired or known for their intelligence actors are known for their looks and possibly their acting skills but intelligence and critical thinking does not come in their school of thought so please do not send me videos by actors and say see he got successful attributed law of attraction elon musk was successful and did not attribute the law of attraction what you're pointing out is rare exceptions and i'm also pointing out rare exceptions elon musk warren buffet whatever who didn't do law of attraction now the general law of attraction sim might have the argument that oh they were actually attracting things they really wanted things well truth is that's very generic advice if you really want something and you work hard for it there's a much higher chance that you'll get it this is so obvious in college or school you want to get 100 100 now if you study every single day you really want to get that 100 100 maybe to impress your parents you study every single day you do the question papers every single day obviously you're going to get a much higher score than if you did nothing right this is an obvious thing i don't know why there's a book about this but the problem i have with the book is that it's about thought and not action you think i really want this i tell myself i want a hundred times but i don't put in the effort and i don't think i've seen a single example of somebody who's thought about it who really is attracting something and not put in the steps right and the minute they put in the steps you can't really call it the law of attraction it's just hard work which is not a special rule see there are millions of people right now using the law of attraction just thinking about it trying to attract it and very few that are successful we look at the people that are successful and say she did it he did it the thing is this sort of thinking has a lot of survivorship by us we're only counting the successes we're not counting the millions of people who tried it and failed when you're trying to do a study you can't just look at the successes and ignore all the failures because there are plenty of failures and we need to sit and ask the failures how hard did you try and poor people we passed them off and said they didn't try hard enough they didn't think about it hard they didn't attract it hard enough that's such a cop out right that's an easy thing to say this reminds me of college right there was a kid next to me who just didn't do well and the teacher said it's your fault it's just it's just pretty stupid right it's an easy way to say oh you didn't try hard enough or you know that guy he did it perfectly that's why he's successful it's called survivorship bios instead you have to look at the entire sample size and see did everyone succeed using this or at least a good chunk succeed using this or is it just like three four exceptions because truly there are like maybe a handful of exceptions who have claimed law of attraction helped them and also got successful so i want to tell you a science concept here right the difference between causation and correlation i want you to take a situation maybe ram went to the park okay and in the park he felt sick we don't know you know it looked like covet symptoms but he felt sick now would you claim that all parks cause people to fall sick no right whereas tomorrow say raj went to a place where there was a lot of code maybe he went to covet center maybe went to wuhan when covert just first started and he actually got covered people tested him and it was covered right and then he felt sick would you be able to create a relationship would you say this causation would you say that because he had covered he got infection but in the first case you can't say because he went to the park he got infection so park and sickness are correlated they both happen at the same time but one did not cause the other whereas covert and sickness have a causation one did cause the other so that is very important that's what we try to differentiate in scientific studies which is did these two things just happen together or did one cause the other with law of attraction all the cases that we've seen it's always correlation two things happen at the same time and it didn't happen for many other people as well but did you attracting something give you that thing absolutely not there was a correlation and that is what we try to differentiate in science so basically the book is an anti-science book and all the progress we made over the last 200 000 years basically that book says the opposite of it and drops into the ocean now i will find a compromise if you are someone who really believes in law of attraction has read all the books i find a compromise for you the compromise is use law of attraction as a motivator believe that you can do it start there that believe you can achieve something and then put in the work use that belief to help you put in the effort because effort is going to give you rewards i can think about making youtube videos but if i don't actually make the youtube videos i will get no followers or no subscribers use your idea of law of attraction to actually motivate you to put in the effort that's the compromise that i'm hoping for i've said this before but compounding and consistency actually negate the randomness in the world do not expect biscuits from the world instead be consistent so that the day the biscuit comes you've continued to hold a bowl out every day so that whenever life throws your biscuit it might not be today maybe six months later eight months later you are prepared because you're putting in the effort and holding that bowl is you putting in the effort that's all i got to say for this video bye [Music]"}

{"video_id": "VXzWbutanjI", "title": "Breaking down Sequoia’s founder memo", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXzWbutanjI", "transcript": "cello let's go let's go let's go so ladies and gentlemen today i am going to introduce you to a document that one of the largest vc firms in the world sent to all its founders the document is called adapting to endure right it sounds like a buzzword or set of buzzwords but most people in the industry this is not limited to sequoia alone so you have been learning or seeing the fact that startups are not able to raise money anymore especially growth stage startups are not able to raise money anymore there are reasons for it and today we will dive into the reasons i only skimmed through the document now we will get to deep dive it with each other see i am going to tell you the perspective i have about this as a founder as a founder i'm going to tell you which of these things apply to me which don't most of it applies to me but i'm going to tell you how i am thinking about it do i want to lay off employees um you know how do i think about profitably you're going to see all of it in today's video ready let's go i'm just going to switch to the uh yes okay awesome hopefully you guys can see my screen if you can't see something because my head is cutting it off please tell me in the chat awesome this is called adapting to endure okay some of the parts of this deck have some image issues that's okay let's just ignore it the first thing is about y way here okay and this i'm just going to read it out to you very quickly i'm not going to go through every point maybe you can't read let me zoom in i want to take you back to early 2000 when i was cfo at paypal it was march 2000 we had closed 100 million at a 500 million valuation a month later the nasdaq which is the u.s stock market experienced a sharp decline it bounced back a little in mid-year and then sank dramatically by year end okay michael moritz quickly provided the sequoia perspective recognize the moment expand runway become a business become a business people keep talking about business like you know some hard to understand concept business but a vc perspective of how a company evolves is very different from the perspective that the average person on the street would have a vc is investing in products they're investing in a business but they start off or they know that a business starts off with a product so this is usually done by two three hackers you know sitting around a computer in a garage almost every famous startup story goes like this right you're sitting in a garage with two of your friends you're building something cool you don't know if it's gonna be worth something or not that is when you go out and raise your first round a precede small route 300 400 thousand dollars take you can hire two three extra people because in the us each engineer cost you hundred thousand dollars right it's not like india where you can get an engineer actually even in india today a good engineer would cost you a hundred thousand dollars but um back then it was hard so what you do you put together a five six-man team get your product to the market the product at this point is still not a business and i will explain what that means right when you start off let's say let me give you an example of a product let me say you are making a vacuum cleaner i pick vacuum cleaner right and you have a five-man team to come up with a vacuum cleaner you have designed it nicely now you're taking it to the market now suppose you get five sales or ten sales some proof that the market wants what you are giving it then you have to build resources and an organization around the product this is called a business i'll pick vp of sales higher karaoke then you're going to hire a vp of marketing then you're going to run performance ads then you're going to run influencer ads all of that all of it together is the business you're going to manage how much money you have you're going to manage how many people are there in the organization what their salaries are so that's what sequoia wanted its companies to do up our product experiment now become a business okay it is a get real moment for the team for paypal he's talking about his 2000 experience because 2000 is when the market crashed actually crashed one year before that but 2000 is when most people uh believe that the market fully crashed we had seven months of runway left can you imagine you raise 100 million but you just have seven months of runway left that means you're burning more than 10 million dollars a month now you might think wow that's crazy but it's not crazy because when you have an organization around it when you have hundreds of sales reps when you have hundreds of marketing people it is hard to know exactly what is going on as a ceo today i'll be very honest i don't know exactly what's going on at the lowest level of the company i don't know i don't sit in every sales call anymore i have four people who do that right and i only talk to the vp of sales he gives me feedback and i'm like i i change my strategy accordingly right but in larger companies there's even more people more layers more levels ceo has no idea what's going on ceo is the captain of the ship but the captain of the ship can't see very far right so seven months of runway they did two things first is they ran exercises in operation expenses second is they turned product market fit into a business they knew that people wanted the product so they converted that into a business they started charging so in june 2000 they introduced fees because usually when you come up with a product you're discounting it you're selling it at a very low price discounted price to see will people buy it but to make it a business you need to charge fees you know have surcharge et cetera et cetera you need to make sure you become profitable and they also became a gross margin they checked out the fraud levels on gross margin because when you're running a payments business fraud is important they did stuff on ach innovation it's a banking thing let's not get into it eventually they reached nearly 250 million dollars in revenue in 2002 profitable and generating cash okay two years within two years it became profitable generating cash market cap of one billion dollars and they got acquired for one and a half billion dollars okay let me just zoom in for people who aren't able to see this okay today paypal is worth 90 billion dollars right since that market cap of 1 billion they've grown 90 times 25 billion dollars in annual revenue and 4 billion dollars in pre-tax net income that is crazy right so for most people who say oh it's you're an unprofitable vision blah blah blah it's okay to be unprofitable it's okay to discount until a point after you get to that point you have to transform from a product into a real business that is what paypal did and today as you can see paypal is an awesome business sequoia says this given that market tumult tumult of the last week and the ongoing macro economic pressures and we'll get into what these are we felt it would be valuable to bring our community of founders together to share insight of what is happening and why this is not a time to panic it is a time to pause and reassess great start to a note here's what they're going to cover why we are here what is the macro environment why is you know this why is it seeming like tech stocks are crashing uh what does history tell us because this is not the first time this has happened this happened many times before leading from the front and what is next also how to emerge stronger how to build a good business across this okay the sequoia perspective is rooted in our ability to connect experiences and information across our business lines they've obviously invested in many different businesses early stage late stage growth stage and they're going to break it down they have their entire teams doing it let's not get into this okay regardless we believe this is a crucible moment one that will present challenges and opportunities for many of you crucible movement means a defining moment either you will live or you will die and what matters is how much money you are making and how many months of runway you have for those that do not know runway is the number of months you have left to live as a business and believe it or not for most businesses runway is just six to ten months right now they always believe that every six months we will go out and raise money the problem with that is that you might die in six months and now is a time where a lot of businesses that just have six ten months of runway will actually die so that's why i'm saying this is the time that they're going to be challenges and opportunities you have to shift your mindset instead of having regret about this and saying you know i was caught unawares okay it will be a longer recovery and while we can't predict how long we can advise you on ways to prepare and get through the other side okay this is a little bit broken anyway so the main reason for this according to sequoia is massive monetary stimulus see i think somewhere along the lines u.s just remembered the thing that a fifth standard student would tell his friends right if we have a money problem why not just print money and that's exactly what u.s did they printed so much money it's like joe biden was just like oh problem let's print money oh probably let's print money they printed so much money so much money that you create lots of inflation because when everyone has the same amount of money whenever you give everyone thousand dollars extra people the the amount of goods being produced are not going to suddenly increase right so just because everyone in the world has thousand rupees extra you're not going to start producing more vacuum cleaners that's not going to help you but more people can afford your vacuum cleaners right and because of that you will raise prices because demand is higher when demand's higher almost everyone raises prices because they have the leverage right so what started happening is prices of everything is increased if bread used to cost 20 rupees bread now costs 25 rupees right so inflation sets in and i don't want to go i don't want to go into what how inflation works but uh the point is when you start printing money you get into trouble okay and it's not just printing money right the war in ukraine uh supply chain complexities because how do you get oil from russia back when they're going through all this trouble and many more things right so let's not dive into inflation most of you know what inflation is but what the fed does to control inflation is they turn off the tap right they start till now stock markets looked attractive to everyone including the vc funds right agar map company may invest crew and the ipo six months later that's a win for me stock markets are great everyone's going to go invest in the stock market but the minute the fed starts tightening the tap and they start saying you know leave stock market start investing in fixed deposits so this advice of fixed deposits are bad stock markets are great i don't think that's a universal advice that is great in a bull market in a bear market the fed actually asks you to go invest in fixed deposits government-backed bonds right because they want you to be associated with them which means stock markets crash this is the way to control inflation by the way okay okay there's there was a fed mandated i mean there's a fed mandate they pivoted to uh tighter money we'll go we don't need to go into what this is okay so what does that mean for startups that meant that capital was free which means that people were throwing money at the stock market and one level below the stock market which is private companies so somebody would come they'd see a company like tiger would come tiger global most of you have heard of this very big vc in india they would come and they start throwing money at random companies they'll be like to a child because they know you will ipo two years later and give them a 3x return but the problem is and that's what they call free capital right but the problem is the minute tiger knows that if you ipo you're not going to make me so much money why would i invest in you at your series c series d for those that don't know a company will first do a precede then they will do a seed then they will do a series a then they will do series b series c and series d and so on at every stage they prove more and more of the business they prove key either i'm able to get repeatable users or i'm able to get repeatable make revenue repeatably etc etc and tiger just bets on one of those it go the company goes ipo and then you know tiger gets x amount of return that's what they meant by capital is free and the best performing companies were capital consumptive if you are winning if you have a great product other up world-class dyson world-class vacuum cleaner then what do you want to do what should you do next you should go out and market the out of it you should go out make noise blow trumpets you know clap whatever to get attention to the vacuum cleaner because all you need is to build a great product that people want and sell that product to people how do you sell product to people you have to get their attention you do influencer marketing you go you know give money to uh angkor varico and you say hey can you make a video about my vacuum cleaner right so that's how you do it but and that's why these are capital consumptive that all this marketing activity requires you to spend lots of money lots of money okay but now capital has gotten expensive because tiger is not seeing the returns that you used to see so these have become the worst performing companies because you have such a high burn rate you're spending 10 million dollars a month and nobody wants to put in money in you at six months of runway you are absolutely going to die unless you fire people right so given every dollar is more precious than it was how are you going to change your priorities okay as this was digested by markets the best performing acts assets when rate expectations were following including technology biotechnology recent ipos have been the worst performing assets okay and we'll come i'll show you in in graphs how this looks okay we are now beginning to see how the increasing cost of money inflation flows through to impact the real economy to give you one example in the housing sector in the last six months due to the changing cost of money a new mortgage is 67 percent more expensive for the same house the largest percentage shock in 50 years uh let's keep going let's not go into the complexities of this right i'll digest it for you we are experiencing the third largest nasdaq drawdown in 20 years minus 28 right this is not a joke this is huge a lot of people have lost 30 of the money and there's some people with positions of billion dollars on the markets and today they're standing at 700 million they've lost 300 million out of thin air just because people sentiment and things are getting expensive this is how everything impacts everything if you have a recession it impacts tech stocks obviously if you have inflation it impacts tech stocks um we are experiencing the third largest nasdaq drawdown 20 years it's been an incredibly volatile last six months in the tech market if you have questions around this please go ask paytm they launched at a price of x now they're trading much much much lower than that x and not just them right all the tech stocks are seeing this shock um well it's not quite 2001 or 2008 these were two very big financial crashes the nasdaq is down 28 since november and most of these people believe it's going to get worse right which means everything gets harder okay 61 percent of all software internet and fintech companies are trading below pre pandemic 2020 prices tell you what that means okay one in every two more than one and every two you take a you throw a stone at a company very high chance that they are trading much much lower than their pre-planning to 2020 prices right this is bad because obviously it reduces excitement in investing there okay and i'll tell you i'm now going to step into your shoes okay if you want to invest in a crypto but you know all cryptos are down 90 instead of you saying buy the dip and you might say buy the dip because you don't have a big position but if you had huge position in bitcoin huge position in ethereum would you sell or would you buy more you know of solana or something new you wouldn't right because you'd be like let's wait and watch this looks like a spiral sometimes you can't tell if it's a dip and it's going to come back or if it's like a straight downward spiral that's what we see is a little bit worried about okay uh let's go let's keep going one third are trading below covered lows when uncertainty and fear was peaking let me show you something okay let me show you zoom stock price look at this crash right they had a huge crash let me go to six months look at this before the pandemic or during the pandemic zoom was considered one of the best companies right because everyone needed to use zoom obviously but just see how zoom has gone down this people don't need zoom as much their activity is less their revenue is obviously going to become less everyone thought and we see again for all the intelligence that we think vcs have they are also surface level thinkers right you ask vc to go one level deep they know everything you ask we should go two level deeps they're sitting ducks i don't know what's going on right so something like a zoom which was considered because everyone thought pandemic is going to last 10 years everyone was saying oh we're going to have this hybrid remote work and normal work system not happening right and zoom is one of the companies to suffer through this right and there is a lesson for us i don't want to make this a boring dry finance session right there is a lesson for this and i'm trying to get to the lesson so let's move through all this growth at all costs is no longer being rewarded okay because there was a time in vc land and vc stands for venture capital growth at all cost was being rewarded if you're growing if you're growing users ten percent every month let go and make noise as much noise you can get more users make more money right do it all but you look at this revenue multiples of companies and there's something called a revenue multiple of company right a company always trades at us you know 10 to 12 x of what they're worth so if you are making one million dollars in revenue your real value on the market will be maybe 12 million dollars actually this applies only to companies that are 10 million dollars and above so if you're doing 10 million dollars of revenue then your multiple would be let's say 10x you'd be trading at 100 million on the stock market but now you're trading at 5.8 x it's gone from 12x to 5.8 x in like such a short period of time the last time we saw this was so many years ago ten years ago right it's crazy um so it's a it's not a good place to be when you know if you're making one million now your company is only worth six mil six million dollars or five point eight million dollars earlier it was 12 million dollars that's a big difference big difference right in fact it's like because this happened my net worth in the network that i have in avalon and the value of avalon as a company that is that would also be slashed by half that's almost like a drawdown we didn't do anything wrong we're in fact growing we're making money but because the market sees all tech stocks poorly my net worth would have been slashed by half right that's the crazy part about this right you can do absolutely everything perfectly but you could still crash um market is very sentiment driven rather than you know based on any unit economics but things like inflation which are real things like the increasing cost of goods which are real impact things right so growth at all cost is no longer being rewarded the era of being rewarded for hyper growth at any cost is quickly coming to an end revenue multiples across software have been cut in half over the last six months and now trade below the 10-year average that's crazy growth adjusted multiples have fallen even further and are well below the 10 year average and pushing the 10-year lows 10 years we've had a bull run tech is now seeing a 10-year i mean we don't know how long the bear runs going to last but it's going to be a bear bear run essentially okay focus is shifting to companies with profitability finally finally you know i always believed in grow at all costs it's important to grow at all costs right because if you don't grow somebody else is going to grow but last year was just a joke last year was like people throwing money at anything anything with video conferencing in it because of the pandemic people are throwing money at it obviously right like you can't have businesses that like we were doing this with avalon um scenes right when we were consumers social a lot of people asked us consumer social we had about so a little bit history about avalon scenes today we're a community app we help businesses run their communities we give them infrastructure to for them to run their communities but in the past we used to have an app that anyone could run come and run their communities we were growing fast we had 150 000 users we have we had 2 200 free communities but we were not making money right and the goal was grow grow grow grow one day you will figure out how to make money which is true right it's happened for businesses like facebook but the problem is if all investors in the world at the same time think the companies that are not making money avalon would have died that is why in 2022 early and obviously we knew this and even the investors knew this far far before sequoia put out this right because sikhoya thought it's like a minor dip but it turns out to be a longer dip because we understood this we said okay let's put a price tag on let's just put a price tag on scenes and sell to people who have money right so focus is shifting from uh to companies with profitability and anyone else who is standing outside this is going to be caught duck out right and we'll and we'll show you how what that looks like uh the focus on near-term momentum is often shifting towards companies who can demonstrate current profitability this is also a problem with how vcs work we think that the way vcs work is that they invest in companies that can become massive companies that can become billion dollar companies that's actually not entirely true that's important yes but more importantly a vc when they invest in a company they all they're momentum investors that means they don't exactly know what the company does right even my investors i would bet if i had to bet i have 40 investors maybe more than that i bet like half of them don't exactly know what avalon does or don't exactly know what scenes does they invested because they had spare capital they've not just invested nothing interesting like 30 companies right but um why do they invest they invest because momentum when you're growing fast you don't want to miss out it's like you many of you would invest in dogecoin without even knowing what the fundamentals are because you see that graph going like this you're like i don't want to miss out it's like fomo it's former driven you might think smart vcs investing millions of dollars are not going to invest through fomo they absolutely do it's momentum investing that's the only way we seize invest and that's actually a good way to invest because for companies growing fast chances are it's going to grow faster and for a vcu invest in 10 companies like those nine will fail the one that succeeds is going to make you so much money that it doesn't matter that the other nine have failed awesome the market is signaling a strong preference for companies who can generate cash today okay cheap capital is not going to come to the rescue we've already gone through this you cannot just raise money from anywhere we're not even going to go here this is boring durable growth while improving profitability is always the path try to be a profitable company even if it takes longer right it's not just valuation but real economic risk economy risk with a weakening consumer the average consumer is weaning itself off stimulus stimulus means u.s has given everyone extra money the consumer is kind of trying to get off that money or has almost gotten off that money everything is more expensive right and that shock of everything being expensive you can't print money this is economics 101 i don't know why the us did it but they just went and printed money they just like you know took out an hp printer and just started saying okay we'll just print more money that's going to solve our problems it's just going to delay problems to later um but over the medium and long term disciplined durable growth is always rewarded and translates into meaningful value appreciation we learnt this in 2022 jan 2022 that's when we became a b2b company even though we had options to stay b to c or b to b we went b to b because we were like this is going to make us money right it when people look at us they're like oh you said you're going to build the next facebook you still build a good business but it's b2b b2b is boring like it's boring but it makes us cash i can durably grow this over the next god knows five ten years whereas in b2c the risk of failure the risk of success is one percent for me to go out and say i'm building the next facebook one percent but you look at crms customer relationship management tools in b2b there are 100 customer relationship management tools all of them are successful all of them have slight differentiation but it's not the same with b2c once facebook game myspace died once instagram came facebook died once tick-tock instagram is dying right only one can survive at the same time in fact in any consumer you like you'll find usually two successful companies think about it okay let's do let's do an exercise let's talk about food tech in food named two large companies swiggy zamato okay now name the third name the third ubereats ubereats got sold tapso tapzo is dead tiny all tiny holes dead food panda you know they are that like i think they're dead or they got acquired one of the two next segment talk about edtech name two large the two largest at tech companies by jews and academy what about the rest right talk about skilling upgrad and uh what's the other one uh there's one more i think jigsaw right so in every space you'll find two big winners two big winners in consumer but in software in b2b you can have 30 winners you have 50 winners any differentiation is okay even if you say okay i will build something custom for you that's a differentiation if you say okay i allow customization customization you don't allow customization it's okay but in consumer it's always two it's always two awesome what history tells us let's go through history okay so they have lived through 2000 and 2008 crisis in the past two years the pandemic forced the government to stimulate print and throw money the war has impacted gas prices obviously gas prices are really really important for exports right if exports slow down then people don't have money because their exports are not coming if they don't have money they're not gonna buy they're not gonna buy whatever you're selling on your app is not gonna work right because they don't have the money the only way to stop inflation is to stop purchasing with less money to buy it shrinks the economy which is what the government is trying to do by the way actively and recovery will be long recall will actually be long it'll take a very long time for this to happen okay it won't be quick sequoia does not think this recovery will happen tomorrow which means they are saying that this is going to be a tech recession and this is sequoia right then they're not going to like come out one day and be like recession and then it doesn't happen tomorrow they actually believe in it they would have thought this through otherwise they would have said this in january so the question of who survives who survives okay i don't know why this is some graphical issue adaptability it is not the strongest of the species that survive not the most intelligent but the one most responsive to change darwinian this is charles darwin in a nutshell right people think that it's the strongest of the species that survive it's not it's not the intelligent as well but the most responsive to change if it starts raining you should be able to build a shelter if it's sunny you should be able to build a hat right you need to adapt as the situation changes you cannot be static so and this is where i'm going to come into the part that i both like as well as dislike survival of the quickest now let's say there are two companies okay company a and company b one is green in color company b and company a is blue in color okay sorry uh orange in color so company is spending money spending money spending money to spend too much money okay and then they don't have money anymore seven months of runway seven months goes over and then why am they're dead this is called the death spiral where you just cannot raise money nobody's willing to invest in you and you are going to die effectively you are you can't do anything about it whereas company 2 says oh there's going to be a crash let's hit the brakes let's fire 600 people so what happens you've seen all these layoffs right you've seen the unacademy layoff you see you saw the um so many companies have done layoffs right i don't even want to go into it um the minute a layoff happens and you let go of 600 people let's say each person cost you a lack the 600 lakhs per month you saved okay suddenly your bond rate goes down whoop goes down and then you have longer to live slowly you can increase your burn rate again that's why layoffs happen it's not that the company need necessarily is doing badly is the fact that companies like trying to avoid something called the death spiral that's why everyone's firing people they're trying to do it in the nicest way possible but they are firing people avalon is one of the only companies that is not firing people why because we are profitable that's number one b and we have not even fired one person actually we fired one person but for non-performance not because of you know because of this not even one person because we are profitable we have a lean team and i always believe that small lean teams are the ones that build the greatest products um and our consumer base in the u.s u.s can spend far more than india there is this thing okay which i really dislike in india every vc will push you to build a consumer indian company because it's exciting right the average vc partner in india a person that can write check in a vc can that can actually sign a term sheet the average vc has a net worth of 100 million plus 100 billion dollars plus because obviously when flipkart goes ipo at 16 billion dollars if you own 20 of it and you know it's a lot of money right obviously you have to give some of that money to the lp the people who put money in your fund but let's let's not go into that right the thing is for them to build another b2b sas business is boring it's not fun but consumer next facebook ah exciting i want to be part of the journey because it's not just about money for them it's about status when you did flipkart when axel did flip card axles of vc when they did flipkart they felt good about it and they're like we are backing one of the first few e-commerce companies in india we're going to take this to the finish line and when it went to the finish line when it sold to walmart at 16 billion dollars they felt really good about it status plays a bigger part like all of you guys think it's money and you know we had this conversation about sandeep maheshwari as well right like i had the previous video about him everyone's like oh he doesn't monetize he doesn't monetize dude after you make a few million the next goal for you is status why do you think a company why do you think avalon today that's worth god knows 200 crores why do you think we are trying to play to be a 20 000 crore company do you think the extra money matters to me do you think the extra money matters to my co-founders to my some of my investors yes but to mostly investors they're like they want to be part of an exciting journey and it's a nice thing to say right oh my company is a billion dollar company they're playing for that status it's not for money anymore after they don't even most of them uh entrepreneurs that i've met lots of people who are billionaires or my capital who have invested in us sujeeth from udaan kalyan krishnamurti from flipkart uh he's the ceo flipkart right now they've all invested in my company right but for them this is about the excitement it is less about making money that's a side effect and you should stay away from investors who invest just to make money okay um avoid the debt spiral do layoffs okay companies who move the quickest have the most runway and are most likely to avoid the death spiral do the cut exercise projects research and development marketing other crap expenses stop it stop anything that is not critical to the main cash flow generating part of the business because every business has a cash flow generating part that's the immediate future and then they have a longer future they have a longer future which is you know what do we do three years down the line five years down the line okay it doesn't mean you have to pull the trigger but that you are ready to do it in the next 30 days if needed in 2008 all companies that cut every single company that cut were efficient and better don't view cut as negative but as a way to conserve cash and run faster even though to the media and the public it seems like oh these people laid off 600 people so sad for the people if they were good people in any market good market bad market if you are good talent if you're a great developer if you're a great marketing person if you're a great sales person whichever if you're a good talent you will always get a job that company might be trying to avoid the debt spiral because the last thing you want is to not fire 600 people and then have to fire 6000 people two weeks later or or two months later then fire 600 people and keep the jobs of 5400 it's a it's a balancing thing right either you should you drop all 6000 people like fast.com did when they crashed or you know you tried to balance it i'll let little few people go so that these people can survive it's like there's a boat a lot of people on the boat or ship and ship is starting to sink because it's so heavy so you throw some people out it sucks but if you're a good swimmer in any market you will get to the next ship they will always do well going to the next ship luckily for avalon we knew all of this was coming way before in 2022 jan uh we had some inkling that this was coming we had a great finance guy in shashank so shank was like bro we need to like tighten our ship right so we made the necessary changes uh companies that make the changes here are you know in a little bit of trouble my problem or my worry is that vcs right are like a car they're like a mercedes car you sit inside the car founders are the driver okay now you can drive the car in two ways you can drive the car slowly and slowly go from 30 kilometers an hour to 50 kilometers out to 80 kilometers an hour slowly break slowly go you can do that or you could slam the accelerator go to 100 kilometers an hour and then suddenly hit the brakes you know and then suddenly accelerate again when the market gets better suddenly hit the brake when market gets worse who gets affected the founder will have airbags and airbags because at every round the founder can usually convert some of his stock into cash especially if you're a mature company you can do that you can keep taking a few million dollars out in real cash convert stock into cash who gets affected it's the passengers at the back their heads are always like you know going to the seat and coming back and going to see it and coming back so i feel that um it's not fair for them to put that on the passengers but as passengers here's my advice right unless it's a company that is profitable jump you jump ship i'm serious you jump ship unless you know you're super critical to a company in fact have that conversation if you're an employee and you're working in a startup and how much ever com money the startup is raised you have to go and ask your ceo will i live if the answer is yes then great if the answer is no move don't wait for that mass you know firing to happen cool next is about choices what decisions do you plan to make versus what decisions do you wish you had made okay when you have just six months of cash left focus becomes incredible in every company you know the ceo ceos are artists they have a little bit of art in them three projects i'm guilty of this by the way in my previous companies right i've done three things at the same time four things at the same time but when you have six months of cash left and the reason is when you're profitable you don't have this issue in fact that's the problem with profitability right like you know you're going to survive forever so you'll be like let's start the next project because you'll survive forever as long as it doesn't take too many resources it's great but when you have six months of cash left focus becomes incredible you can do one thing you have to do what makes money and believe it or not it's it's so obvious that you have to make money but when you get in the driver's seat and you have five million in the bank and you some good investors invest in you and you feel awesome about it it's easy to get misled and start doing 30 things unrelated things right but focus is important and you get it back and you just work towards the money okay you cannot overtake 15 cars in sunny weather but you can when it's raining there is an opportunity when the market has crashed when it's like this which means everyone that's here let me go back up every company that's here can be destroyed that by companies that are here if you can cut make sure you live forever make sure you're profitable like what avalon's done you can destroy the companies that are 10 times bigger than you and spending ten times more money than you it's just a thing right this is the opportunity that sequoia talks about so who wins the the founders ceos who face reality adapt fast understand that venture capital is not going to save you if you have six months of runway you have to be profitable in those six months you no time for you know wasting time have discipline rather than regret and recognize that it is easier to preserve cash when you have more than six months of left runway left recruiting is easier because i'll tell you this is a crazy thing right this is going to happen all engineer salaries are going to drop by exactly the same thing that the mortgage like 67 plus right in fact they're going to drop as much as the stock market is dropped in fact more because when the stock market drops every vc starts closing their purse so the developer salary the average developer in india is now if you if you have like three four years of experience is mainly like 30 40 lakhs and annum i can guarantee you that will go back to 20 lakhs and annum there's no cash in the ecosystem who's going to pay you that much earlier you should get three offer letters so you can auction yourself if you're getting just one offer letter you can't auction you take it or leave it right you might get kicked out of your job in fact the people that are expensive are getting kicked out of the job just a thing like a company looks at the top 10 most expensive things because that's the easiest way to cut burn because see you could have 30 people in sales each costing you 50 000 or you could have one guy costing you one and a half crores it can happen right who do you fire if you had the choice sales brings you immediate money if your products already done why do you need one guy who's like super duper expensive right and i'm sure most of these companies have multiple you still need leaders right but you can get rid of anyone who you think is unnecessarily paid so you'll have a bell curve if you're not at the top of the bell curve your job is gone right and it's going to get cheaper to hire new devs because once you go back on the market and you think you were worth 60 lakhs the best the markets offering is 25 you are going to feel depression you're going to feel like your net worth or your salary or your value has gone down but that's not true like i said somebody else is driving the car somebody else is hitting the brakes you're the one who's like head is hitting the seat at the back you have to recognize that right awesome all the fan companies now have hiring freezes they can't hire okay how to emerge stronger what do you do at this crucible moment either you can go up or you can death spiral what do you do it's hard to predict the future but whatever happens we want to give you a framework to emerge from any crucible moment stronger you know the decisions that you make will be pretty consequential and you might be in for a fight right obviously companies that don't don't raise money are fighting every day finally these guys get to fight that'll be interesting who wins the dog that's on a leash from venture capital or the wolf that's been out hunting in the uh you know jungle by itself now that's awkward for me to say because i have raised venture capital but we think more like a bootstrap company because i come from a bootstrap mindset right chance only favors the prepared mind at sequoia we believe that the one who wins is the most prepared okay if the one with all the money is the one that wins how could zappos go up against amazon and win the shoe category how could doordash come from behind and emerge as the market leader beating ubereats how do businesses like clubhouse die the one who is best prepared for the fight clubhouse was not prepared for the fight of random indians coming and having sex chat on their app which is what happened by the way they were not prepared so if you're prepared you win which means to be prepared you have to grow slower you have to have enough time to figure out what you want to do is it going to work at scale et cetera okay so how do you prefer um prepare your mind prepare your team and prepare your company okay first thing you have to prepare yourself your team and your company so let's start with preparing your mind first step is the hardest every crash starts with the founders not confronting reality market crashes that's true if you're a great company no matter whether it's a good market or bad market you'll raise money but most founders today or most business in india today even the unicorns are crap companies right think about paytm mall okay paytm mall was a unicorn uh sale price payday mall exit value sorry 13 million they sold for and they had a valuation of 3 billion do you guys know what percentage let's do that 13 million divided by 3 billion and 200 i don't know this will give the math 0.4 percent wow that's really low i don't know if i'm calculating it correctly anyway the point is it's a very small percentage right as the founder as the ceo you have to confront reality there's only so much that your team or your board will push back okay there's probably no more no better illustration of the first three bullet points here than a gentleman called admiral james stocktail very interesting story very interesting story it's called the stockdale paradox okay he was the highest ranking u.s military officer held as a person of war during the vietnam war from 1965 to 1973. he was tortured over and over again but he made it out of there while many didn't when you ask him what didn't make up why he didn't make it out he retorts the blind optimist they were the ones who said we are going to be out by christmas uh yeah but six months we'll be out christmas would come and then christmas would go then they'd say no no we're going to be out by easter 12 months over there like another six months you know they're going to let us out how long can they torture us and easter would come and easter would go then thanksgiving and then it would be christmas again and they died of a broken heart sometimes you die when you lose steam when like normal put out this tweet right companies die when the founder loses motivation when the founder runs out of steam not when because of the market or this or that okay he would go on to tell many of his prisoners we are not getting out by chris ember by christmas deal with it if you confront reality and if you say this is what the market is then you confront it i know a lot of kids who go out and say that you know um with their investments in my business i tell them today it's impossible maybe last year though you had a chance on an idea to raise money but now please go with the product and please go with some consumers please go some some sales okay you have to prevent yourself from spinning into a negative cycle uh cycle in 1998 i was cfo of link exchange and we were attempting to take the company public but on 8 31 1998 the market dropped hundred points in r okay there's a russian ruble crisis uh so they have to stop an ipo without the ipo they're going to run out of cash i was working so hard it wasn't the crash wasn't their fault i started to feel bad for myself and it went dark fast which is preventing me from solving the problem at hand how to snap out to get out of the predicament okay now this is sequoia pulling a sandeep maheshwari where they're doing courage over fear courage is a decision so choose courage this is what i don't like vc's for a little bit right obviously i understand them wanting to motivate their founders and stuff like that but when you are the one that has been throwing petrol in the car and pushing it and now you're asking your founders to break and you know be passengers in the back are hitting their head and you're the one telling the founders to break it's like you know you're standing in front of the car and putting it like a red light sign but also saying these things like courage is a decision choose courage i find that a little bit annoying we will prevail okay again motivational crisis leads to opportunity so this is true though right if other people are suffering if other companies are struggling and they're dealing with burn rate i can race past those companies because i don't have those challenges right now right as long as we're profitable we don't have those challenges we have plenty of runway um [Music] anyway yeah with the change point the strong can become weak and the weak can become strong the once coveted growth stocks are being dumped and the value stocks value stocks as stocks with uh real profits are being coveted right most unicorns in india last year we celebrated all of them most of them are not making money right or are wildly unprofitable the change point is what allows for the opportunity if you see the opportunity clear clearly and i'm prepared to seize the moment okay prepare your team this is harder because as a founder it's my job to kind of take the emotional lows right it's my job it sucks it's hard and that's why you know the motivation kind of helps but i also realize that motivation is surface level right what really helps being prepared and being able to tell your team because your team is what really matters right how do you navigate the ship you're standing in front of the ship you can see a cliff you can see a rock in front of you and you know you're going to crash into the rock titanic how do you turn back and tell your team to navigate without them panicking okay so there are two kinds of people in a company and i've noticed this to be true one is called the mercenaries the other one is called the missionaries mercenaries are people who are like you know deadpool you can hire them for like 30 dollars an hour they'll come shoot for you and then they're gone next they'll go to the next company and shoot for them a missionary is somebody who truly believes in the mission right it's like missionary the word missionary comes from the religious people in christianity who would go to different different lands and tell them the value of you know christ right so with companies you need people like that who truly believe in the mission and are willing to tell the story and the mission and the vision of the company even when you are not there as a founder who really believe in that the mercenaries are the first to decap anyone offers them more they will leave because they are hired guns okay when we couldn't go public at link exchange the mercenaries were the first to leave and that happened at airbnb and doordash after 9 11 sales went to zero at zappos and the mercedes fled to larger companies like uh such as amazon this happens again and again as long as you keep the core team together and i've learned this the hard way by the way you can have 50 employees but the core team is going to be like six seven people if you can keep the core team together and they believe and you're fully transparent with them about how much money you're making um you know how much runway you have whether there is a you know a rock in the way or not they find it easier to trust you and they also you know they feel like steering the ship together with you right it's it's something that it's your job as a leader okay and you also need to know your audience you need to know what each person wants okay they need to continuously be reminded of why they joined your vision of the future whatever you believe in and avalon believes in the idea that everyone's going to own their own community at one point right at some point might not be today it might be six months later might be three years there might be ten years later that's the that's a long-term mission okay they're all looking to you for direction as a leader it kind of becomes your responsibility right like i have 40 investors 20 something employees um lots of customers an audience it's my responsibility to tell everyone what's happening keep them all aware right and you know not no better than you know kind of just running through this memo directly align your team ask for commitment sometimes it's much better to go to a team member and say hey this is going to happen i need your help okay if you're in this great or leave light in the lifeboat or leave right if you feel like you don't want to go through this hard time you can leave and chances are it's hard for you to find a job anywhere at this point because the crash that's happening all tech stocks are like hitting the floor all right so we lend this very quickly finally it's cash and cash flow okay you have to make sure that uh you have to make more money so this is exactly like us we pivoted or rather we started charging a price for running a community earlier we never charged the price it was free but we like airbnb pivoted to long-term stays we start we pivoted to adding a price tag to communities uh that helped us that's easily going to help us survive this okay uh improve unit economics okay obviously best is earn more goodies improve unit economics okay is like cut extra burn okay and finally if necessary raise as much money as you can even if it's expensive last year you could raise 5 million at a 20 million valuation or you know 5 million or 30 million valuation even if you didn't have anything this year i doubt you'd be able to do that valuations are going to drop you need to prove more uh you know you're going to raise less money but you should do it right and ideally people tell you don't raise debt paul graham keeps saying don't raise debt airbnb did a 10 debt deal right even if you don't like the terms you should do it doordash had two very difficult rounds zappos debt and equity deals they really struggled concentrate investments in their future you won't be able to cut your way to a business this is also true right you can't like fire everyone you can't like say i'll go back to three employees and then figure it out you can't build a business like that so you can't keep cutting there's a bottleneck to which you can cut you can cut to a like a floor but don't cut beyond that try to build your business okay you still have to focus on the future focus on what's working most important leverage investments means what is working move back from the undisciplined pursuit of more random things okay airbnb cut everything most of the product um team but invested more in core hosting and longer term stays longer term stays pays airbnb consistent money so they focus there i can guarantee you in india when this is happening everyone's going to move b to b all the consumer companies that were you know trying to make money here in their little bit here and there are going to pivot to b2b that's something that i foresee right unless they've already figured out consumer uh i feel in consumer one of the things that will work is gaming but apart from that in india it's like very tough to build like a highly profitable business um zappos got marketing but invested in customer service selection engineering okay what for avalon we have completely gone into um uh product as well as content and you will never see that content by the way this content is fully directed into the us go to uh build on scenes.com blog you'll see all the content pieces that it's not even targeted towards you it's targeted towards us we wrote a book in jain called community masters we wrote it because we are targeting the us we don't even care if anyone in india doesn't see it because you guys are not our audience anymore when we were running a free app of course all of you everyone was an audience but now we are very specific about who we target and we don't want to target anyone else okay constraint so the power of and versus either or thinking the problem this is a problem with a lot of youngsters that i've seen right when you're young when you're 19 you can be everything you can be everything the problem as you get older is that you have to choose one and you'll realize that consistency matters if you want to be a doctor they will not trust you if you've only been a doctor for one year you need to be you need to have done it for many years plus you learn more about it if you want to be a founder investors want to see you in the ecosystem for decades right if you want to like you have to choose one because your reputation matters on one of these things so you have to choose one even if it means closing your eyes to other very juicy very lucrative opportunities right so when you recognize your constraints when you know that i need to be successful in two years when you give yourself a timer even though people say don't give yourself a time when you have a personal runway okay six months college is done i have to figure it out in the next six months you can focus more on coming up with a better solution that makes you money rather than you know throwing money at the problem due to lack of funding zappos forced to grow with ltv cat payback on first order which means they couldn't lose money that just means until now they were selling at loss now they're not selling at loss created their own gift card program okay created their own store credit program extended terms for merchants from net 30 to net 90 days they said okay merchant we'll give you money little later i hope that's okay so that they could keep more money liquid cash to work um right they did brand marketing programs such as advertisements in the shoe bins for very low prices right that's crazy i wouldn't do that but that's crazy i want to show you airbnb's board update on april 5th okay why would airbnb have a board meeting on sunday well this was april 5th 2020 2020 is when pandemic hit you know airbnb went to zero nobody could go out and travel and stay in a place so their revenue would have probably gone down zero they went 30 year on year growth in january to a flat year on your growth in february to down 30 year on year growth in march they were like down he knew april would be bad brian presented these slides before the board meeting to get alignment so this is what he said this is a slide once in a generation crisis make sure airbnb is around for future generations that's all brian brian chesky's the ceo of airbnb he's just like we want to make sure we're here survival this goes from prophet banana  that survival okay so principles these are very easy principles be decisive which means make decisions and you might think what decisions are easy to make but for us to pivot from b to b sorry b to c to b to b took us four months it's like four months of thinking we're getting users can we make money we're getting users can we make money to saying it let's just focus on making money right you might think it was an easy decision it was not because so many people you tell 40 investors you tell your team that oh bro we're doing this they're not fully supportive but you have to tell them and it takes time four months it took us we realistically should have taken us 30 days okay but we decide being decisive is hard preserve cash which means it's quite obvious right avoid the death spiral act with everyone in mind stakeholders are people who have shares in your company or you know hold some value of your company act with them in your mind emerge as role models not villains when you fire people when you lay off people the media can paint you as a villain you come across as a horrible person right like that's what's happening on twitter right now like bro we have to be a role model we have to be open about this not be the villain okay because it's easy to be painted as a villain play to win 2021 travel season it we lost 20 20 that's fine next year we will win well everyone's not investing in travel we will win okay and don't trade in the future which means don't cut so hard that you have no employees to do what you want to do in the future okay so we need to do four things they need to do four things one is raise money manage our stakeholders diversify our business which means get to more profitable businesses cut costs okay awesome that's the airbnb finally i want to talk about one more thing which is let's get to it leadership principles how do you lead how do you convince communicate all this okay forces communicate with conviction conditions means that you have confidence in what you're saying so it's very easy to tell if you don't have confidence in what you're saying okay so confidence in what you're saying with confidence to the external world and calmness okay no panic remain authentic the minute you start you know speaking in pr terms everyone can tell that you're being inauthentic except fans of certain person uh balance of optimism and realism be optimistic about the future but realistic about today okay these are some strategies for uncertain times first is simplicity scales complexity does it the more complex your business the harder it is for it to scale the simpler it is and this not only applies to the product it also applies to the business if you have a very complicated organization chart simplify it in marketing to give you an example avalon is doing five things okay we're doing advertising we're doing a little bit of influencer marketing in the us we're doing a little bit of seo we're doing a little bit of like lifetime deal sort of thing and we were doing a little bit of direct sales now we've just gone to two ads and seo simpler it's not like we shouldn't be doing the other things but right now we just want to do simple things and do it well right so we took the two things that are performing really well like let's double down here speed is the greatest business strategy like i said taking decisions is hard double down on your top talent price is law there's a lot called prices law in a company 50 of the work is done by the square root of the number of people if you have 100 people in a company only 10 people do half the work so double down on them give them the resources sit down with them give them the coaching whatever is necessary make them win right and alignment over agreement not everyone is going to agree if you say hey let's do this some people be like what the i signed up for something else so get alignment tell them i will try this first then i will come you don't have to have everyone to agree right it's hard tighten up the value proposition to drive sales right figure out what it's exactly that customers are coming for and paying for do this that like with avalon um if i were today i wouldn't build the metaverse channel we have a channel called metaverse channel i wouldn't build it because that doesn't improve sales it improves it attracts like a marketing pull but it's not the thing that drives sales we will focus more on the things that drive sales further things that drive sales are boring parts things like api things like web hooks again this is if you're non-technical this doesn't matter to you but very important to us right if it's not it's fluff if it's not one of these it's fluff either drives revenue growth saves money reduces risk okay anything else is like useless so one more thing that they talking about is push versus full leadership which means push means you're motivating people you're like and pull is i'm going to do this you want to join me very different type of leadership um awesome okay so we're ending this now i know it's been a lot of doom and gloom so far from it we believe that the best most ambitious most determined of you will use this moment to rise to the occasion and build something truly remarkable that was true for cisco after the crash in 1987. google and paypal in 2000 airbnb in 2008 dole dash in 2020 but we also believe that winning in the years ahead is going to depend on making hard decisive choices confronting uncomfortable challenges that may have been masked during the exuberance and distortions of free capital over the last two years one adjustment for everyone including me is when i raise money now my expectations would have been like you know 100 ml round next now i have to bring those expectations down right 100 ml valuation down i have to bring those expectations down to whatever instead of 10x or 12x have to go down to 5.8 x right have to adjust in my head probably even lower but it is what is what it is right if i want to raise um i'll have to raise the terms that the market gives me primary goal of the session was to shift our collective mindset this is not free reign anymore this is a crucible moment where you have to make decisions now i want to show you one last thing gaurav munjal said he said something yeah so gaurav one of the investors in avalon put out an interesting note okay i just want to read the note where is the note yeah he sent an email called winter is here winter is here very game of thrones like reference okay we must change our ways tech stocks globally are crashing and burning due to tighter monetary posit policies and rising interest rates we are looking at a time where funding will dry up for at least 18 to 12 to 18 months some people are predicting that this might last 24 months we must adapt okay they've laid off employees and he says this is a test for all of us we must learn to work under constraints we must focus on profitability at all costs we must survive the winter we have a different goal this time the goal is profitably the goal is to generate free cash flows one good news is avalon has free cash flows and hopefully we keep it like that over the next few months um so munjal suggested that unacademy would significantly reduce its marketing budget and focus on organic growth channels in his note he asked employees to ensure that the company was profitable across every test prep category in the next three months three months he's given them to be profitable and that unacademy centers were profitable in fy 23 he added that business such as re-level and graphi which are scaling up should be mindful about their cash burn and reduce it significantly in october 2021 an academy had allocated 20 million dollars for re-level to expand the online hiring platforms team and whatever blah blah blah okay all incentives to educators that are not linked to revenue have been completely removed or in the process process of getting removed okay if the current situation is as bad as the last two economic downturns the best way to prepare is to cut costs and to extend your runway within the next 30 days they're not even playing the three-month game they're like 30 days but either gonna like get kill or cut like we're either gonna kick you out or become profitable okay your goal should be default alive when capital was free the best performing oh no this is not what we want he added one more thing got off he said this that an academy is always grown with capital and let me just switch back to me yeah unacademy has always grown with capital this is the first time in our history where we'll have to grow without capital right where we'll have to be profitable and build something good so it's exciting to see this happening to the industry this is going to happen across and it's exciting that you know we will get to watch all of this live it will teach us so many things till now all the kids in india are seeing a bull run on the stock market thinking that geniuses i remember there's one kid who commented on my uh video saying that one of my videos saying don't invest if you're young saying that today but i made 10x on the stock market well you're negative now you should be in the negatives now right so that's the big problem right like if you're investing you have to invest for the long term in the long term no matter you go downs up rounds up doesn't matter in the long term it goes up right and you need to have that mindset right you can't come in the mindset of a trader so um i just wanted to run you through the memo because i thought that you know you guys would learn a thing or two or two uh it's great to see a sane ecosystem till now i would say it's a little bit insane uh all founders are feeling bad because their friends are raising so much more money without any real business so it's nice to see that it's cooled down and it's become sane um for those that want to find um the avalon product it's at build on scenes.com uh i think that we are in good times right even though this it looks insane we are in good times and hopefully you know one of the things i wanted to do which i can't do easily on this channel because this channel is starting to get a little bit messy is i can't speak directly to my older audience not older but like the audience that really cares right there's an audience that comes here just for content watches one two videos about you know how they're wasting their life on dreams but i love the old audience who came in because they wanted to hear my thoughts who wanted to hear breakdowns of this even though this might not be exciting to everyone right the average person in india is like who gives a if you know if the if recession happens or inflation happens so um i want to have that you know maybe a deeper conversation with you guys i'll find the right way to do it the right channel to do it uh maybe you know do a private community or something but i want to do something exciting with you guys i think it's about time i being a b2b business i barely get time to speak to you guys directly so i'm glad this happened i'll find a closer way to make it happen all right thank you so much guys um so one more thing this i think this pdf is like confidential i know i did a live stream on it but i don't know where the link is and i don't want to be the person sharing the link i just want to do a video on it and hopefully i get the chance to speak to you guys directly uh yeah for those that want to know what avalon does on the product go to build on scenes.com let me just send you a link right we're a b2b company that's why you don't hear as much about us right now last year you heard a lot about us because we would b2c b2b our ads go to the us one day i will find something consumer to do i think one of the the thing that irritates me is that i don't get time to like speak to you guys and do something for you guys right i love you guys and i've always like you know i had a soft spot for my audience the people that care that stay till the end of a live stream like this one right and i am going to do something maybe a private club something like that maybe something like the old avalon server but this time on scenes maybe like a communication club we have to have some activity most people don't know this but the avalon community first started on telegram for all of us to learn a language called esperanto i can guarantee you none of us learned that language me neither but it brought us together and we did so much more together on it right maybe this time i'll do something more mainstream maybe a communications club or a way for people to learn english together or something like that something simple that brings us all together so that we become better together and i have something to do with you these days i feel like i don't have anything to do with you so i want to work work on that uh more soon awesome guys love you all bye"}

{"video_id": "vCH_GGFy3iA", "title": "6 Tips To Improve Your Body Language", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCH_GGFy3iA", "transcript": "body language so they say that only half of conversation happens with your ears and your mouth the other half happens with your body and your eyes so in this video i'm going to give you six tips on how you can improve your body language here goes the first tip is maintain eye contact see the eyes of the windows to the soul if you're looking away or you're on your phone people can tell you're distracted it's bloody rude don't do it stare at the other person but not like this you can't look at them with an alien-like stare right that's gonna scare them but what you can do is give people a warm look like this it's not wide open eyes it's sort of open eyes but you're staring in the person with like a warm kind look and it's not just the eyes right the eyes work in concert with the rest of your face the mouth and the eyes work together you can't have a warm look with your eyes with a completely neutral mouth right so your mouth moves along with your eyes have a light smile don't look like this instead light smile that's how you do it when you're looking at another person warm look warm smile warm eyes just makes all the difference and don't use your phone it's rude to use your phone use your phone before the meeting after the meeting but not when you're talking to other people the next thing is head knots you can extend the eyes and the mouth to the entire head if somebody's talking to you and you agree or even if you don't agree you can nod your head so whenever somebody's telling me something i'm not and the reason i'm not is because i'm acknowledging the fact that i understand you i hear you bro and people want to be heard it is so awesome when i'm talking to somebody and they're not in the head you can also chase nods with appropriate questions like i said people want to be heard even if it's an audience of one people want an audience why do you think youtube and clubhouse and whatnot are popular they're popular because people want to be heard ask them appropriate questions based on what they've said don't interrupt you know if suppose they're talking about ice cream don't interrupt and say oh but yesterday john cena did this is this nobody cares if they talk about iceland ask them well what about vanilla questions not statements statements go nowhere the conversation doesn't move forward with statements conversations move forward with questions even if i'm making a statement suppose i'm saying hey folks we should do this i still say folks we should do this what do you guys think i always do that so it's nice to ask appropriate questions and nod your head in a conversation the next thing is that you gotta use your hands now if i just kept my hands flat and spoke to you you probably get bored you've got to use hand animations the thing is i was actually studying my own hand animations right like in general how i speak when i'm speaking i do this a lot and then i understand statement with this sometimes when i'm talking i do this right i stretch my entire arms i do this when i'm making a point so depending on what i'm saying i have these animations that i unconsciously created for myself and i am aware enough obviously to study them 99.9 of the world is not going to be aware enough to understand what hand animations they make when so you have to figure out what kind of animations you make when you're making a point when you're asking a question when you're ending a statement you gotta understand where and when you make these hand animations and for god's sake do not cross your arms if i did this and i spoke you would switch the video some of you are anyway switching the video this means you do not want to talk to the other person they should leave you alone sometimes i've seen the grumpiest people in the world always do this it's just a learning from life right so don't do that the next thing is to copy style right i do this a lot like i copy another person's style if they're talking and they're in a certain way i also change my accent so when i'm speaking to somebody in kannada especially that person is karnadega my accent the way i change my hand animations everything change same with hindi right like i'm my hindi is not the greatest but i will speak with the same accent the same speed as the other person with english i speak fast with kannada i speak very slowly even though i'm reasonably good at canada right with hindi because i'm learning i speak slowly but my hand animations also match the other person so i copy their style because it just makes them feel comfortable it's not about me it's about them i want the other person to feel comfortable i speak slowly even when when i'm speaking to somebody who doesn't know english well i speak very slowly because i want them to feel comfortable finally please understand the difference between assertive aggressive and submissive either you're submissive where you know you listen to the other person or you're aggressive right you you put your point across you don't want to be either the better version of submissive is not aggressive if you are submissive and you're told you're submissive you can't just be aggressive you can't be like i'm going to beat you up whatever that's not what you want to do you don't want to play the macho man that doesn't ever work what you do want to be is assertive assertive is neither submissive or aggressive it's not even in the middle it's something completely different where hey this is what i would like you to do i'm still asking nicely hey this is what i like you to do thank you this statement that i made was neither aggressive nor submissive i'm being nice and requesting by saying hey this is what i would like you to do i'm not giving them ways out i'm not saying oh can you do this or this or i'm not saying you have to do this you can be polite and still put your point forward would still put a statement forward most of you can't do this because you're afraid right you're afraid of what will the other person think or you're just afraid of putting your statement down putting your foot down and you need to invoke the testosterone to do that you don't need to invoke testosterone to be assertive you can just be like hey i would love if you could do this that's assertive lastly don't fidget don't keep you know doing this and like you know moving your fingers around don't do that when you're fidgeting it shows to the other person that you are nervous you can tell when somebody's knows like i can always tell when somebody's nervous every meeting whether i'm hiring somebody whether i'm you know talking to somebody whether somebody is pitching me and asking me you know for money whatever i can tell when somebody's nervous so i feel like a lot of these things with body language the more meetings you have the more number of people you speak to especially people off the power table like a lot of you have no problem speaking to your friends in college you speak exactly like this but the minute you have to do a vc pitch or you have to speak on stage whatever all these you know weird things come out in my opinion that's because there's a difference in power table when you're pitching to somebody even maybe a billionaire and asking for money the power table is like this you're here they're there so all your fidgeting all your submissiveness it comes out then you just need to practice being lower on the power table and still keeping your body language perfect the more you do it the better you get that's it for this video make sure you subscribe no fast content bye

{"video_id": "34fp5QO9Yz8", "title": "This PHILOSOPHY Changed my LIFE", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34fp5QO9Yz8", "transcript": "now i'm very sure that you and i agree that this world is unfair unjust and random now there are two ways to deal with this the first one is trying to reduce the amount of unfairness and randomness and unjustness the only problem is nature is massive and it has many moving parts and humans have figured out only the tip of the iceberg so there's only a certain amount we can reduce the uncertainty and unpredictability of life the average human used to live till the age of 40 about 100 years ago but today through our fight with randomness and unfairness and unjustness of the human body and of nature we have managed to bring that up to 80 to 90 years in india the second and a very effective way to deal with this unjustness and randomness is to adopt the school of study known as stoicism tourism asks a very simple question at the center right if the world is random and unjust and unfair why does it bother you it bothers you because you have a brain and your brain perceives the world it perceives others perceives other situations it perceives your situations and then creates a model of whether you are thriving in your environment or you're not your brain is always perceiving that and what stoicism says is that an unjust random world only affects this part of the brain's processing it only affects us because we think and we worry and we create comparisons stoicism says the cure to that is to change the way you think about these situations change the way you think about randomness change the way you think about unjustness or the effects of randomness and unjustness stoicism is school of philosophy it was actually founded by zeno obsidium in athens in the early 3rd century bc it's a philosophy that's informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world it says the goal of life is eudaimonia stoicism essentially teaches that virtue is the only good and things like health wealth and pleasure they're not good or bad in themselves it's what we make of them right either we can choose to accept the situation we're in or we can choose to battle it stoicism chooses acceptance radical acceptance in fact of the situation that you are currently in to live a good life stoics also believed that you truly had to understand nature and the sciences in order to live harmoniously with it they also believed that somebody who radically practiced stoicism would be emotionally resilient to any sort of misfortune because let's face it in the times of the old stoics there was nothing but misfortune in the world there is a lot today as well no doubt about that but in their times we never knew what was happening inside you we didn't have advanced imaging medical imaging we didn't know whether we'd be attacked by a neighboring kingdom and lose everything we have the next day they didn't know any of that so stoicism had two very prominent authors or champions the first was the roman emperor marcus aurelius and the other was seneca marcus aurelius wrote a bunch of notes to himself through his lifetime and these notes even though they didn't have a formal name marcos aurelius never intended for these notes to reach the public or people like us the name of the book was meditations there's also letters from a stoic by seneca so as you can see stoicism had wide impact on everyone from a philosopher to a king the first thing we need to understand is why did marcus aurelius a king turn to stoicism shouldn't his life have been awesome a king after all so much territory so much conquest then why pray did he turn to stoicism well the secret is in his life he was betrayed by his wife he had to personally go deal with all of these enemy conquests his faithful servants and court members betrayed him and finally it is said that marcus aurelius suffered from ulcer which obviously in those days was not treatable so he spent many years of his life in extreme pain and not just physical pain but also emotional pain and when you're going through so much in a world that does not have antidepressants or any other sort of medication you have to either invent or turn to a school of philosophy that helps you adapt or cope with that sort of world with the kind of pain you are facing internally stoicism was that answer for him the core thesis of stoicism is the dictamy of control it's not just stoicism that does this right a lot of religions also do this or have this thesis that you need to learn between two kinds of events events that you can control and events that are not in your control if a flight is delayed because of bad weather no amount of shouting at the flight attendant is gonna do any good right so that's an event you can't control and we take it out by trying to punch or use somebody close by somebody we can shift the blame on as a punching bag and we do a lot of this online right if we're not happy with something we immediately blame the government no matter how much wishing you do if you are on end stage cancer there is very little you can do you can't become taller because you wish it you can't become shorter because you wish it you can't get you know somebody you have a crush on because you wish it you can't do any of those things so if things don't work out in your favor learn that these are out of your control and the way to deal with what you can't control is to completely accept your situation it gives your brain freedom like i mentioned in previous videos your brain likes chewing on a problem right given enough time it will chew up the problem for eternity but accepting a situation gives your brain that freedom to let go to stop chewing on that unnecessary problem that you've been chewing on for a while so stoicism literally asks you to figure out what are the problems that are worth chewing on and what are the problems that are worth letting go of sourcism also goes forward and says that you should journal you should write down because when you write down it gives you an outlet instead of punching the flight attendant because there's a storm and the flight is going to be delayed you can write it down as long as you have an outlet that lets you put out these emotions these pent up emotions and these emotions are about things you can't control as long as you have an outlet for it you will feel much better you will be more resilient to this misfortune and talking about misfortune stoics practice misfortune they practice feeling what it would be like losing everything right they do not get complacent in the things that they own because they realize and in their head they think about it what would it feel like if i lost everything tomorrow if i felt sick with cancer tomorrow how would i feel that should be my default because as you guys know it's it's easy to be comfortable in the riches and the comforts of the modern world but thinking about misfortune and practicing it as they call it is something that might add value to your life because you are prepared and ready when that time comes stoicism also believes that every situation is what you make of it what situation you might call bad is a situation that another person might call good so you have to find a way to turn the problem upside down and see if there's a way you can find opportunity in it for example if you lost your business because you know some new competitor came out maybe it is a chance for you to figure out a new way of doing things or take your learnings and build something out of those learnings in famous examples of slack and discord they both actually started as games and they both built internal communication apps just for their team and as the games failed they could have cried and gone home and said hey we failed but instead they looked at what they'd built and they said hey this internal tool that we built why don't we make a business out of this right and as you know the rest is history both are massive companies but both are examples of taking a problem and turning it upside down and sourcism also goes one step further by saying that even in situations where you can't find a solution that situation is teaching you something if you lose someone close to you that's a chance for you to develop fortitude for you to develop emotional resilience if you're dealing with somebody who's very hard to deal with it's teaching you patience and understanding and empathy so everything is a lesson as long as you remember that it's a lesson and also understanding that one day you will crumble the universe will crumble everything that you know is gonna be dust in fact it's not even gonna be dust it's gonna be done right it's not gonna exist understanding that that our lives are short and measured gives you a new perspective towards it in fact stoics perform an exercise called memento mori where they think or they imagine their own death it's called meditating upon death whether it be your death whether it be someone else's death whether it be the death of somebody close to you understanding adapting and accepting death both yours as well as the ones that are close to you is something that stoics often do it sounds crazy and it sounds like something that you know would give somebody depression but that is the point the point is to get into a low mood because of you know facing death head-on and then overcoming it by accepting it by radical acceptance of this fact and stoicism is also something that i think a lot of influencers today would you know really find value in see when an influencer or a creator gets negative comments on the internet they get very worried and when they get positive comments on the internet they get happy but as joe rogan says right i think he said it on one of his podcasts he doesn't even read his comments he is neither you know elated by the good comments and neither is he depressed by the bad comments he says i don't care there's a healthy level of detachment i love what i do i love my fans but there is detachment between what i do and what they say about me both the good people and the bad people so alan watts once was talking about anxiety and he says that a lot of us try to fight these forces of nature right and that gives us anxiety but he says take the example of a leaf in a storm a leaf moves with the stone a leaf is one of the most adaptable facets of nature and leaf's not the only one right every other aspect of nature is adaptable to the forces of nature humans because of the hubris we have inside us believe that we can fight nature and say yeah you know come on i'll take you head on and not move the problem with that is if the leaf never moved it would crack so similarly you need to know when to take a fight with nature and when to let nature take you along i always had a hard time swimming when i was young or floating on my back when i was young because i simply wouldn't let go i wouldn't let the water take me to where it needed to be i would fight it i would try to stay afloat until i learned that it's about letting go any time with nature it's about letting go the truth is that indifference this detachment from what is happening in nature the goods the bads it is truly a power right and it actually takes away nature's control over you because emotionally you don't give a  understanding where you need to interfere and understanding where you need to let things be now a lot of people will recognize the teachings of stoicism in newer age psychology like cognitive behavioral therapy so a few years ago we ran a course called calm india where we had some of the best psychologists in the country come and put together a course on cognitive behavioral therapy for anybody suffering from anxiety or depression and a lot of those teachings are exactly the same as the teachings in stoicism so it's not like psychology is something that's completely dissociated from what philosophers of the past have figured out it's pretty much the same packaged in a new way and obviously charged by the hour i want to end this with what marcus aurelius used to tell himself at the start of every single day i shall meet with meddling ungrateful violent treacherous envious and unsociable people he prepared himself for the worst to come and that is exactly what i've started doing on an everyday basis these days and it's what you should also consider doing all right that's it for me bye

client right i've worked with a lot of clients i know what pisses them off and i've also been a client i know what pisses me off so let's assume you've got a project let's assume you're on upwork and you've decided to take up maybe a graphic design project which is cool and you've been asked to design a flyer so you know you get the brief you sign the contract and you open photoshop and you've started so i'm going to take you through each day okay day one you're doing a research you're on pinterest you're on instagram and you're putting together a mood board like yeah flyer should look like this yes i need a flyer to look you know maybe red background this one looks good this one from marvel looks good this other one looks good you collect it all you're putting a mood board together now day two you fired up photoshop you put your main characters in between right and maybe you've put a c in the background maybe you're making your poster blue you know you've made it a little bit marvel looking this is going to be an awesome poster you think now day three you had a small change in idea you think that the character shouldn't be in the center they should be in the bottom all the text should be in the top so you move to the top work on the fonts you're making like one of the best looking posters in all of time right it'll look awesome the client is going to be extremely happy cool now i want to flip the site i want to show you what the client is thinking i know what you're thinking i've shown you what you've thought through day one two and three i want to show you the client is thinking you need to hear this because you don't know about this day one okay so day one yeah i've paid the money you know i'm sure uh the freelancer is gonna put out some good stuff and you know i'm excited i'm excited to see what he'll put out day two i haven't heard from the guy yet uh you know maybe he's having some emergency or you know maybe he's just waiting for something but i wired the money yesterday so i'm getting a little bit anxious day three oh i'm getting scammed this is a scam he took money from me i've not heard from him he has completely disappeared right this needs to be solved i'm gonna go file a case i'm gonna go file a case with upwork i'm gonna go file a case with police this guy's taking my money on the internet and run away you see what's happening in your head in your bubble you're doing a great job for the client you're putting in all this hard work this effort this time this energy but in the client's head he's gone from happy to scammed right because he has heard nothing from you look businesses freelance projects relationships especially client relationships depend on clear constant communication now even if you had done nothing for first three days let's assume you sat on your couch and ate nachos even then if you had sent the client a message every single day saying hey i'm working on it i'm figuring out the mood board whatever it is as long as you were in constant communication even if you didn't produce anything the client would be happy with you now why does this happen you have to understand that when you're a professional especially when you're a professional freelancer you have two jobs the first job is to put your skill in action and produce something of value and the second job is to give the client a great experience great experiences are constant communication constant communication doesn't mean asking the client hundred questions it means telling the client what you've been up to without disturbing him or her by saying hey today i did this or i'm doing this next or i'm working on this clients love that right it really makes their life better to know that somebody cares somebody gives a and the opposite of that is a client getting bloody scared because you haven't replied to him at all if you paid for something and nobody responded to you you are going to get upset and you're going to get angry right so when money is exchanged you have a responsibility to stay in communication the client and that is the number one thing that pisses clients off in fact i wouldn't hire a genius who is not communicating i would rather hire a diligent person who communicates every day with the potential to become a genius in a few years i would rather work with people like that because i've worked with the other side and they are horrible now one tip here if you're working with cheaper clients clients who are paying you less paradoxically you need to communicate more when a client is paying you a hundred thousand dollars chances are that they've already done their due diligence they've done their research on you they've seen your last projects they trust you right and usually there's one person who's responsible for reaching out to you and making sure this coordination happens on the smaller projects if somebody's paying you 100 for the entire project expect them to eat your head right because they don't have the experience and for them it's 100 is a lot of money to lose for a large company like ibm 100 000 is chicken feet so paradoxically smaller clients need more communication than larger clients right so keep that in mind and make sure you're always communicating bye [Music] you"}
{"video_id": "kFOqci-3WPs", "title": "What is the RIGHT AGE to Get Married?", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFOqci-3WPs", "transcript": "this is a video i never thought i'd do there is no right age to get married let me be honest about that right you can get married at 40 at 50 at 60 whatever you want right we invented the concept of marriage humans across many different civilizations invented different concepts of marriage so no one set of rules applies to you but i want to talk about something a little bit different i want to talk about how in india there is actually a right age and this doesn't come from some pundit it doesn't come from the sky it doesn't come from some god it comes from a little bit of mathematics and a little bit of psychology there is a right age to get married in india because if you miss this window your pool starts reducing and in this video i'm going to tell you exactly why before i begin i actually want to tell you what the right age is the right age to get married is 25 to 27 25 26 27 now that doesn't mean you can't get married at 22 it doesn't mean you can't get married at 40 you can i'm just saying this is the best sweet spot age to get married to know why we need to go back a little bit earlier we need to ask ourselves why people can't get married before the age of 18. now as you know learning and brain development are still going on till 80. that's why people don't recommend getting married before 18 plus it's child marriage right let's talk about the next bracket 18 to 24. now i personally believe that 18 to 24 is a terrible age group to get married because you are immature and so is probably the other person if they're in the same bracket at 18 you haven't even finished college the danger of getting married at that age between this age group is that you might be so immature that you might make the wrong decision and the thing is if you get married in that age group and later on in life you regret who you've married then you can't undo it and i'm not a big fan of the american you know get married and then leave by the 10th anniversary in fact half of all american marriages end by the 10th anniversary and before the 10th anniversary i'm not a big fan of that i'm more of a right or die person so if you're taking such a heavy decision in life you want your brain development to be complete and you want to be mature enough you want to have enough of a mental model of the world to be able to make the right decision because between the ages of 80 and 24 both boys and girls don't know what they want right anyone telling you otherwise are exceptions and if you are an exception you can get married at any age now one exception to this is the childhood crush right somebody who finds their sweetheart in college and ends up getting married to them now we've seen this trope of childhood crush in so many movies especially bollywood the problem is it is very very very rare in fact you're more likely to get married to a crush you found in post graduation which is after the age of 21 22 then you are in under graduation or school the thing is most people when they start dating below the age of 20 they're not even thinking about marriage so chance of a childhood crush working out is very low now i also haven't broken down the two types of marriage in india right you can get married to somebody you love or you can get an arranged marriage for a bit i want to talk about the love marriage aspect of this right because i think more people are now marrying people they know you know not getting their parents involved to find somebody who you might fall in love with you need to have a pool of friends in the first place your school friends are not going to be friends with you forever they're going to have their own constraints same with your college friends they're going to move on so between the ages of 22 to 95 it's the best time for you to make a pool of new friends who you might want to be with for rest of your life even if you don't get married to any of them it's still people you will hang out with for the rest of your life school or college is not forcing you to be friends with these people these are people you've chosen and you've picked out because look falling in love is giant distraction it's a good distraction for some people it leads to a rush of chemicals in your brain i would rather not have you guys spending that time falling in love and getting completely distracted right you won't be able to focus on either now i've told you that 25 26 27 is the right age remember it's not just me that says this right it's also your parents and not just your parents it's also the parents of anyone that you might want to get married to at the age of 24 parents will start putting pressure on you because they know it takes some time to generate leads and you might think oh this is so silly why don't you equate it business and marriage how stupid but this is reality this is exactly how your parents think your parents do think in the pipeline format and they know it takes time to generate so anyway pressure is going to be put on these people so that's led us to 25 26 27 being the ideal age now you might ask why not 28 why not 29 what happens after 27 well the problem is after 27 the pool of people you can probably get married to in a love marriage starts shrinking and same with an arranged marriage why does this happen this happens because parents have started putting pressure on everybody at 24. now if you get lucky and a lot of people can get lucky right there are exceptions then well it works for you now with arranged marriages even if you find a suitor who's younger than you their parents might reject you because you started getting old believe it this happens this is the regressive indian mindset but what can we do about it now above the age of 30 it's almost impossible you can't go date a 22 23 24 year old some can but this is an exception like i said and their parents definitely are not going to let you marry them because you're 30 and you're probably you know you have a chronic disease and you're starting to bald it's just life right and above 24 25 people have already started getting married so your pool is just really tiny and there is this what i like to call the spike at 28 29 right there is a small spike in people urgently trying to get married at 28 29. in india and even abroad it's very common for post 30 marriages to be with widowers right widowers getting married to each other or you know somebody would who's been divorced getting married to somebody else that's more common than you know somebody looking out fresh for a relationship it still happens it's happening more often than it did in the last decade but what i'm trying to tell you is the math says that the pool is small you want to optimize now i want to put a disclaimer right across this entire video anybody watching some some people watching this video will say hey it makes sense and some people watching this video are going to just get outraged how can you make something as special as marriage into a game of math and psychology i don't believe in that right i believe you can only get lucky if you make the attempt to get lucky you have to put yourself out there and you have to put yourself out there at a time where other people are putting themselves out there otherwise you're shooting yourself in the foot that i'm trying to say what everyone in their head believes partly this is because of indian parents and the other part is because we also have some of these things in our head as humans we are puppeted by our limbic system and a lot of things you believe and a lot of things you say don't match with each other so i would suggest if you're outraged by this video to first introspect and then ask yourself is this true or not because i've seen right i'm i'm actually married i've seen this i've seen all of this happen i've seen it play out life so 25 26 27 is not the right age to get married it is the sweet spot in terms of indian mentality to get married that's it for me bye [Music]"}
{"video_id": "unw547VU83M", "title": "How to CRACK INTERVIEWS without Skills!", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unw547VU83M", "transcript": "so i've evaluated more than tens of thousands cvs i've interviewed thousands of people and hired more than 250. in this video i want to tell you a cool little hack that you can use to actually get in and beat an interview without having the skill set required now one caveat here this is obviously not the smartest way to get a job the better way to get a job is to have some skills and sell them to an employer here it's more like your selling potential and this is not going to work you can't step into a senior coding interview and get past without knowing any skills without having any skills it is just not going to work so you can't apply this everywhere you can only apply this to fresher roles when you're just starting out in your career and when you have no skill set and have no other options it's not going to work 100 of the time but when it works it works well so let's assume you're completely unprepared for an interview okay maybe you're doing product maybe you want to apply for the product rule maybe there's a junior product role that's opened up in a company now you're gone for the interview you're sitting across the table from the interviewer and the interviewer starts asking you product related questions you have no answers to any of those questions so here is step one pivot the basis of the interview all interviews have a basis of skill right the first interview especially not the culture interview but the first round interview is usually about the skills that you have are you relevant and useful to the company you have to pivot the interview from does this person have skills does this person have potential so you're gonna start out by saying hey i need to say something i don't have all the skills you're looking for but i would like to learn and i would love to shadow you and i'm happy to do it for free basically you're being honest and vulnerable about what you know and what you don't know if you do know some stuff you can mention it even without them asking you can just mention it and then show that you really want to be taught that you really want to be coached and you're willing to work we have a saying here at avalon you can fix poor skills but you can't fix poor attitude if somebody has a great coachable attitude we love that and every company loves that right every company wants somebody who's willing to learn willing to put in the effort and you need to prove that you need to prove the hustle and you have to be willing to say i'm going to work with you guys for free be coached as many hours as you want as your assistant if necessary and i will prove that i can learn product by the end of the month now this is not going to work all the time sometimes you might just be thrown out of the interview but all good interviewers know that in the early years of somebody's career except maybe in like very technical roles in the early years of people's careers coachability is much more important with skills can we install the right software on this candidate is what these recruiters are thinking about all the time remember the interviewer on the other side is not a robot they're human beings and you're appealing to empathy by saying i'm willing to learn and i'm willing to be coachable now don't be an and join the company and then be lazy think that you got a job and be lazy you should not do that if you're pitching the fact that you are coachable and you're willing to work hard then you better go and do that use the opportunity you get after you get into the company to wash off all your sins in college you haven't studied in college you haven't got a good job who cares wash it off right now but don't for god's sake be lazy have a genuine interest in learning and interviews can sniff that out and if you don't they will kick you out and one thing to add here is that market awareness is also very important if you go into an interview and say you're interviewing with a finance product and you have some knowledge of the finance market which is easy to pick up it's much easier to pick up than skills people will like you people will say you have keen eye for the market and that's also very important to a recruiter or an interviewer so make sure you go with some information about the market now i've said one thing here which a lot of people take offense to which is be okay with working for free see if you see yourself as a product imagine your one or two months that you're giving them for free firstly you're learning you've anyway spent four years on college doing nothing and you paid for college why do you expect to be paid when you're being coached again in fact here you're actually getting coaching in the real world right so this is something that college didn't even offer you and you paid them so much money so don't be desperate for money at this point think of yourself as a product and think of this as the free trial you give a one or two month free trial and if they like it then well they're going to continue in that free trial you have to prove that you're good enough and probation especially like startups now have started doing a probation period because you often can't tell how a person will be in the first month somebody could sell you and say oh i'm very skilled you know i'm very coachable and then the first month in the sitting and watching netflix at work it can happen remember that that one month is your arena to prove that you are actually coachable and you can actually pick up skills that's the very important part and if you walk away even if they kick you out after two months but you walked away with skills and market intelligence that helps you nail the next interview so remember that and don't ever be afraid of selling your skills for free especially if it gives you exposure we are in a country where there are 600 million people with a mobile phone and internet and there are so few jobs especially tech jobs so few tech jobs so anything you can do to gain attention and awareness do it don't think in terms of why i'm being exploited especially if it's like a short period of time and you're benefiting from this because you're not going in some skills if you're going in some skills and adding value to the company and they don't pay you that's a crime but if you're going in and you're being coached and you're taking those senior guys time away from them then i don't see how you have the leverage to negotiate a great salary for yourself and after two months three months once you've proven your metal then ask for whatever you want and chances are they like you because obviously the people the seniors in your team are human beings if they like you you will get paid what you're worth that's it for me i thought you knew that step up in the function all these women like who that got me looking like money yeah they love me yeah true that big rats new bag new swag wing cutting no slack why they mad don't do that"}

minutes to spend time on self-awareness or research and the problem with that is you get out of sync you let the world run you rather than running the world you're not able to figure out what opportunities exist in the world in this video i'm going to tell you what the idea of an asymmetric opportunity is and why free time is critical for asymmetric opportunities see when you invest early in a company and you guys are obviously familiar with investing and how it works when avalon used to invest in companies back in the day the goal was to find something that was undiscovered an undiscovered gem polish it until it gets to prime time and you reap in the financial upside of that for example if you invested in bitcoin 10 years ago i don't have to tell you where you'd be i think the internet's done enough of that but the real question i ask you is how would you discover bitcoin 10 years ago i'll tell you my own story because i think the first time i dabbled in bitcoin like six or seven years ago and i dabbled into it because i had a bunch of friends and those friends just had a lot of free time they dabbled on the dark net some of them were reddit familiars like i used reddit very often right for example i'm part of reddit community like ethereum and solana and when something's popular when something's happening and people are going crazy about it i see it first it takes some time to go from reddit all the way to twitter and then it goes to your instagram and youtube instagram youtube is lost by the time something is reached instagram youtube it is already too late so what does an asymmetric opportunity mean an asymmetric opportunity means that you investing now or you spending time on this now or you committing now will give you a crazy asymmetric return many years later it's not linear it's not like you do something now and you get the same reward 10 years later you get an asymmetric reward the risk and the reward are on two completely separate planes but the problem is access where do you figure this out and thing is because now i got older and some parts of the internet have lost sync with i found two ways for you to find asymmetric opportunities the first one is to have friends around you who are willing to tell you like i have this one guy on i met him on instagram and he gives me crypto advice he just tells me why don't invest in this invest in that buy this by that this is going to go up it's going to go down he tells me he's right like 90 of the time and he's doing the research and sometimes he sits and explains to me he was explaining solana's taking to me before i even knew solana's taking was a thing right so you have friends around you who are willing to give you what i like to call alpha alpha stands for information so you either need somebody to give you that alpha which could be for example you following me on twitter and learning a lot about product and business or you following some crypto guys on twitter and figuring out oh this is something i should invest in and make money are you following shashank and knowing that this talk is going to go up tomorrow so in summary the first method is to have friends who are willing to give you this alpha the second method is to snoop around for this you need to be connected to forums i always say that the magic the real capital on the internet is inside hidden inside forums so i had a friend his name is karan right and he was working a company making like 30 or 40 000 rupees a month very disappointed with i assume right i'm not not the most interested in it and he spent a lot of time reading and researching about crypto just reading and researching and then he actually went out and launched his own nft project right out of the blue nobody expected him to do it launched an nfp project made a lot of money made more money than he would working 30 years in his company 30 years how did he know when to do this and why he'd be successful because he saw similar projects and he had enough time to dig in see you and i are busy when we see something interesting for example if i tell you leverage farming it sounds complicated but when you when you actually click on the website or when you actually click on the reading material within two or three days you'll realize this is simple for me believe it or not investing in the stock market is still a pain my aadhar card and my mobile number are not linked with each other for me it's because i'm lazy i'm too lazy to do it i'm very sure if i do one or two days of research i'll be back in speed but i don't feel like doing it i'm looking for better opportunities in fact at avalon i reserve some free time for myself to try and look for the 10x opportunity try and look for an opportunity where i can have a great outcome rather than trying to always look for a 10 increment outcome how are you going to do this if your teachers are whipping you into assignments and your parents are pushing you into the next entrance test you're not able to spend enough time looking for the x bet that will give you a 10x return and to do that obviously you'll make five x bets out of which four will fail but without doing research how you're supposed to do this most of the time that you guys are spending investing in stock is because somebody else told you buy this you haven't done your research you're not spending that time so spend that time spend that time in the darkest corners of the internet start with following the right kind of niche influencers then go on to reddit because reddit has a good way of bubbling up the opportunities especially all the finance and crypto groups on reddit remember wall street bets drove gamestop up by a huge amount and that started and ended on reddit there's a group of financial investors that just decided we'll pump this today and people like you and me missed out on that because we were not in that group every day you write down that you're looking for the alpha and reddit is the first place to start because it's community driven alpha see as a ceo i try to free up as much of my time as possible so i can look for these extraordinary bets so i can try these experiments but i don't think this is something that's reserved to a ceo i think everybody should be doing it if two hours of research can save you 30 years of your work life why not try it because these exist it's just you have to find them before everybody else once things become mainstream like nfts become mainstream now very few of the new ones are making good money but in the early days people made more money than you can imagine right so always be early and always get the alpha early and the only way you're going to get this is by reserving your free time bye and make sure you subscribe [Music]"}

Watch this! ft. @tanaypratap", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DJ90d6uBEw", "transcript": "tonight bro i have a problem okay as you know avalon we've been hiring developers software developers and other people other roles as well but we've been having a very specific problem here people just ask for ridiculous salaries right and i think one very toxic trait that's developed in this industry and i know you're a developer so whatever you say you have to be measured and careful because the industry is looking at you dude one toxic trait that's developed people join a company work there for three months get paid x then realize the best way to get a big jump in their salary is to switch companies right because obviously promotions happen at the end of the year you get 10 increment right but you jump you get 30 increment right and right now there's a madness man everybody right is like throwing money at developers right so i've seen people switching jobs every three months right i don't hire such people if you switch like three jobs in the last two years i don't take your resume seriously neither does my dev team right because we want stability we want people who can contribute over the years right right why are people doing this i understand the money i understand this is the most toxic hack right now just keep switching companies first company second company 30 second company third company another 30 right and pretty soon you can have a sizeable package why are people doing this i think first of all thank you for putting me on this tough spot i have to thank you for this welcome yeah so i think uh so i have been talking to a lot of developers around this and my views are unpopular opinion right i'm against switching a lot and i'll talk about that but the question is why are people doing it i think it's it's the same right wire why are uh founders raising vc money left right center right because money is there in the market and if money is there in the market there are two things first the ingrained greed lalach is there right it's it's for future security future safety that's there definitely but the bigger thing here is and you have to understand this is peer pressure all of these developers go and hang out on blind go and hang out what's blind blind is an app where you can get to know everyone's salary and everybody boasts their salary hey i interviewed here i got this much cash and this much stocks and all of it right so now what happens is every day you start questioning like earlier this used to happen in an office environment right now it's happening globally and with the world being flat you are also getting global offers in and people are saying hey i'm from india i am from this unknown city and i landed a 40 lakh job as a fresher as a fresher right so obviously everybody would want to have that kind of peer pressure and then they keep switching jobs so i think that's the why so is it like a self-validation thing that i want to just feel validated so i need to have as much as the next person yes i mean as a society as growing up we have always been trained to think about what others are having how and we have always valued ourselves into the money which we are making right yeah so so identity is tied in with the capital yep is it going to stop is it going to hurt people in the future because this is all happening in a very short period of time see i feel that that money is just a part of your job there's more to job right this there's job satisfaction there's craftsmanship there's value in in creating value right so if you keep switching every three month every four month you are not getting value anywhere all you are doing is you are creating value in capital for yourself not even as a technical person you are creating value for yourself because for you have to be at one place for a year or two to create value for the company to create value for your resume for yourself so you are not accuring uh value capital for yourself you're just acquiring crash cash right so someday there will be a down and when the down comes in you will be left stranded because you don't have the kind of value which you should bring at six years experience five years experience because you were jumping three months three months three months so you are always doing fresher experience only you are not you're not building complex systems right yeah and you don't have that experience and i feel like personally i feel that's a reputational issue right because see in the beginning of your career you're paid for what you know right your skills right but towards the tail end of your career you paid for who you know exactly and by the tail end of your career you made some money you've hit a ceiling obviously you can't make like a bazillion amount of money uh just keep continuously switching because eventually recruiters are going to notice right you hit a ceiling and now you know nobody because when you switch every three months what kind of relationships have you built definitely you are burning bridges all everywhere right uh it's also a problem of like putting the ball on the other end is it's also a problem of people right if you know somebody has four offers already why would you give them a fifth offer or a sixth offer or a seventh offer so i think founders also should be willingly not giving offers like you said if someone has three months of uh job switching why why i wouldn't suggest hiring that person right so definitely it should be both sided but the market is hot founders need builders right now and that's why it's just a buyer's market right now that's that's what's happening yeah no interesting man what's one advice you'd give young developers who are considering switching three jobs throughout the year or any any role right forget about developers developers designers whatever what was one advice you'd give people who are switching three jobs a year see i think making money is not wrong make money i make money makes money everyone makes money money making is good it buys you all the comforts of your life it gives you a good life for your parents for your future kids for your future wives wives not sorry wife right yeah and so do all of that that's perfectly fine but at the same time understand that after 5 years 10 years 20 years of experience your experience would count for something and if it's just three months of stints everywhere you would not be counted as an experienced person you would be counted as an average hopper hopper right so i i would suggest go ask for whatever money you want if you get that money learn to stick with that money that's okay if someone is earning 10 lakh more it's fine you will earn 20 lakh more down the line so my manager told me this very nice thing right i was telling hey i am getting offers from everywhere you think i'm at microsoft i don't get offers from like all the places think how famous i am as a developer as well right so i get all the offers so i told the manager hey uh this is what i'm getting like 30 50 all of that so so my manager told me see there is there is some value in staying here working at the scale which you are working at and then there is money and that money will always chase you if you change one job there will be someone to give 30 more if you change some that job there will be someone to give 30 more but do you count everything with just money or not that's the question if if that makes you happy if you if you're a person who's who's all about money good luck there's no nothing bad about it keep doing it own it awesome thanks for jumping on and you guys too [Music] you"}
{"video_id": "IsYbSvw3UVw", "title": "Very stupid finance game", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsYbSvw3UVw", "transcript": "ladies and gentlemen welcome to another episode of the varun maya show there is no such thing but welcome to the channel today i've got my friend shashank on who is a finance specialist yes and i brought him on because i wanted to review a product i was in landmark the other day shashank and i saw this product right while i was walking through the kids section yeah and i was like i gotta review this right so i just want to tell you about the state of the country first before i review this i think that finance has become a frenzy yeah it's definitely trending started passing from parents to kids yeah right and i feel not all of it is good so in this video i'm gonna tell you why it's not good with the product this product is called big bull junior big bull junior the stock market game for young traders it's by fun school epic now first thing we mean no disrespect to whoever made this game you know don't take anything personally but this is just in my opinion it's not the greatest thing to expose your kids to shashank and i'll tell you what you can start with the reveal in the open and what what not basically what i understood from this i'm actually very shocked because now everything's trending in the world of finance and we're seeing that older people then we got youngsters entering the stock market and now i'm seeing that big bull junior has been released which is a stock market game for young traders i think preferably at the age of eight uh very interesting i mean damn good traders whitehead junior of similar to that uh but see i'll tell you what for me i keep teaching people about boss it's not easy right you have to do a lot of fundamental analysis you have to read about the financials you have to understand the market and then this comes out it feels like it's mocking me uh straight up in my face right like there's no inflation there's nothing like there's really nothing weird and it's just a bull in bed but anyway let's go deep into the game i'm assuming that it's going to be very interesting uh so let's open this and see what you want to read the things on the back so let me see what are the three steps step one selection of company stocks okay that seems fair i'm assuming there's going to be like a proper way to find which stocks i'm going to choose and there are some stocks called the dosa kingdom news capital uh yota phone similar in a red color black hawk and cotton ministry step two is to manipulate the price so first you find the company stock and then figure out a way to manipulate the price and then you update the price on the price sticker and then the richest person after 10 round wins wow nice so to be a big bull junior you need to manipulate stocks let's do this okay so i'm going to open this now okay oh there's another here's an sheet so they've got a board okay you guys need to see the board for a second and what you do is place these tokens on the board so these are the companies by the way as i said there's dosa kingdom news capital yota phone carton ministry so you place them on the board so the board is basically divided into three segments right there are 10 rounds there's a price ticker like you see in those news channels and then there is bull and bear photos which bear looks more like a teddy bear right now but there's a bull and a bear photo and then you keep moving your either your stock to plus one plus two or i can say you know what baron i don't want your stock to go up i'm gonna put it in the bear market and reduce your stock price by minus one so every um turn you get two chances so first chance you can move your stock by one point by one place in either direction so i can move my stock from a bear market to a bull market i can move my friend's stock or enemy stock from a bull market to a bear market so basically my stock from a bear market to a bull market but their stock i can ruin it so essentially you're manipulating the price and how you're doing it is improving your riches and pulling down somebody else's right do you feel that's the way the stock market works no i think the stock market works in a way where the rich people pull down the people's talk but uh no i think a lot of people especially this game right if you're exposing it to kids about eight i think stock market is very collaborative approach right because the money that's flowing in the stock market is massive and if we all work together we can always find good stocks and we can grow together at the same point but if i'd be like you know what i found this great stock but i'm not gonna tell you i'm gonna tell you a very bad stock to buy a penny stock which will go from four rupees to zero rupees and i'll tell you to buy that but i'll buy something and make rich and he loves to give you bad advice there's not i mean it's very sad right and here is literally like one screw you buy a market minus two you lost ivan right uh but that's not how it works actually that that works on a very high scale when people do that but not in a very collaborative i mean it has to be very collaborative on day one or else i mean see the main thing why why i found this very interesting is because if you're exposing kids right now to something like this right see we have monopoly where there's a lot of different elements okay that's nice but if you expose kids to something like this where i have no idea whether the stock is good or bad uh i'm just looking you're basically betting um yeah it's very similar to betting with no history of this company called blackhawk and my only job is to screw you in this game so i win now you might say okay shashank but this is for kids and you know you should enjoy uh but enjoyment is not equal to me screwing you over and gambling at the same time yeah right then it might as well don't buy this uh then you might as well take your kids for horse racing that's that's actually they have it at least they have data right they're like okay hold on horses yeah betting on horses i mean you have horse weight jockey weight you know past races wins i have no idea what is happening here it's just random luck so you're saying this is gambling where out of these cotton ministry dosa kingdom news capital your phone i'm just picking one randomly yeah and i'm saying put this you know put my money on this so great minds in the stock market over years have tried to derive the best formula this fundamental analysis this technical analysis and then there is no analysis right so i'm trying to figure out is there fundamentals here no is that technicals no uh there's nothing here right so if you're trying to teach someone about the stock market and i'm not saying teaching kids about stock market is a bad thing that obviously i'll teach my kid about the stock market very early on but i'll try to train him in a way where you understand what a company does is the company good because you're not investing in the stock you're investing in the company you're betting on the company you're waiting on the company the ceo whether the environment for this company is good or bad uh so all of those at least those base things right you put a thing okay if you're talking about say dosa kingdom then talk about maybe one good thing and one bad thing about dosa company like what does dosa company make it unique right uh or maybe news capital okay they have distribution that is something that i would want to learn see i had this friend right in manipal and he's a chronic gambler right but when told that bro you're gambling he always tell me there's a science behind it you'd lose money you  money every weekend right but he'd be like there's a science behind it yeah so why is it that people who just bet on different stocks and i'm not talking about kids right now i'm just talking about the market in general think that you know they are doing some foundational crazy yeah is it because whenever the market goes up everyone looks like a genius is it because of that okay so i'll tell you what gambling or you know say for example even stock market in a way is kind of you know in that gambling arena itself obviously if you go to casino they're like okay blatant gambling right but i might be like no i know the facts and stuff like that but both of them are tied to something known as risk right now in the stock market obviously risk is obviously that it cannot crash and we saw that happening in corona nobody expected everything fell down but here you can make a guesstimate right you can just assume that okay this is a strong so for example if i have to invest in reliance tomorrow yeah my risk is obviously lower because obviously he's built his net worth he has so much money sitting in his distribution yeah i mean they've built that empire right now so for them they can handle five recessions coming but if i go to a casino and i put it on a number which is 32 that has no inherent intrinsic value right um so it's all about risk so even when i go and gamble if you say horse racing right and compare it to a number 32 on a relay table now that is most expensive most risky whereas horse racing would be slightly lesser but if i'm going and investing in tata or say the least risk that's the least risk right but there's still risk on market conditions right tomorrow another lehman brothers happens or you know we see a 2008 depression you can't help it right uh but i think it's only about risk and yes in a bull market everyone looks good because it's everything's going up so i keep telling this that the real true winners are the guys who give you good amount of money in the bear market and i've seen this a lot right i made one video about just trading in general and why my views on it are not positive a lot of people in the comments are like you don't know anything i made so much money on trading do you feel like those and these are all like young kids right 16 17 18 do you feel like those people are misled because they've only started trading or investigating the market yeah do you feel they will blood one year later see i'll tell you what the thing is i don't think they're prepared i feel a investor is a complete investor when they see one bull and one bear cycle right because you need to see both sides and all the experts in the industry are talking about that saying don't come into this euphoria and everything's off the charts ipos with big big ipos are coming getting over subscribed investors are taking their money and going out and then you guys lose money right and the big vcs have made their money so it's exit from smart money to retail retail yeah it's smart money to retail exit is happening and if you see the bear market bear market is the most boring market you'll see that there's nothing happening it's just a lull period sensex goes up by three points falls down by maybe 50 points and then again back so on a net to net basis it's going up like maybe one or two percent in a month now we're seeing going up by 10 in the month and stuff like that yeah so now there's a euphoria look at crypto now we don't see bitcoin and ethereum moving right now it's been almost two months it's still stuck at the same rate but when it moved from 8k to whatever 60k everyone's like oh my god bitcoin and people made price predictions to 1 million now everyone's nowhere to be found right so it's always good to see both markets and then make a call and if you are making money right now that's great don't feel bad about making money right now but don't think that you are the king of the world and you know everything about the market because you are playing in an environment where the odds are in your favor to make money and in the bear market the odds are against you so that's how it is yeah in a sense this reminds me of crypto coins yeah right mostly because it's like you have no data around the coin you're like i heard about this so i'll put money in it or my friend told me like tell me be honest right how many of you that invested in the zomato ipo actually went and read the offer document how many of you did that because i bet you're like zamato tomato oh i'll try i'll try to invest because of the hype it's happened right this has happened to what is that coin you were talking about today okay so this is uh it's very weird because i keep tracking it right you know the new virus came out right the corona omicron so there is a coin called omicron which was like a dead coin nobody's been talking about it but as soon as omicron news came out that coin shot up 100 for no rhyme or reason maybe because there's a prediction that oh macron will become famous and then they'll become a new squid games kind of a coin and everything's gone like everything's disappeared game coin came oh yeah they put it up they just camped everywhere the coin went to two thousand dollars went up like a crazy amount of percentage a lot of people bought in at that point and then it just disappeared the next day like there was no there was no coin called squid yes but that's exactly like this you pull somebody else's pants down you put your i mean it's a very zero-sum game right where in in the stock market especially when you're investing in reliable stocks yeah you are betting on that company to do better right so that you are part of their journey and you guys build something together and you are providing the capital they're providing the value in return yeah but what it's become now is like a meme yeah right where it's no longer about the fundamentals of the value yeah you're just like i heard about this i'm gonna put money on this and i'm gonna pull your pants down right so that i show at the end of the year i made 20 you only made 13 haha so yeah whoever made this game we're really sorry we we don't mean any uh i think it needs an upgrade yeah i think i think you can definitely build a better game where it's not zero-sum we're not trying to like you know ruin people's chances and improve yours um and i'm looking forward to that if we had a lot of free time i think we could have just built a mobile game quite honestly very fast and then rolled it out but guys we don't have that kind of freedom so but it'll be damn cool awesome guys thanks for jumping on bye bye [Music]"}
{"video_id": "OaV1vhLBny8", "title": "Secrets of Metaverse! ft. @tanaypratap​", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaV1vhLBny8", "transcript": "ladies and gentlemen welcome to another episode with tane see one of the reasons i'm both afraid and excited to get tane on the show is because whenever i do a video with him it's controversial and we get belted in the comments so he's he enjoys it by the way he sends me like particular comments and he says this guy bro this guy has nothing to do in his life so i really enjoyed his responses in the comments so please keep the comments exciting please actually like take your frustration out on us but remember don't do it on my everyday videos do it here because it's me and me and uh thing awesome let's begin today we want to talk about the metaverse right mark zuckerberg came out stole my company's name i started speaking i started speaking about it in public and as and i'll tell you here's my face right i really enjoy the metaphors so my face went from this to this the minute he announced the name rebrand of facebook into meta because i ran a company called avalon meta and i was like  should have trademarked the name uh we have the entire name avalon meta trademarked uh but unfortunately we missed out on meta so on the metaverse tane what do you think about the metaverse is it the future or is it hype i think it's a mix of both every technology has to have some hype right and at the same time it has some promise so i see i i see the promise i want to stay away from the hype the promises is there right and it's already we are living in a metaverse if you think about it i know more about you than i know about the next door neighbor right and we meet like like once in six months kind of thing yeah right so we are already living in the metaverse we are already living on internet more than we are living in our physical spaces right now yeah do you feel like the varun maya online now is a separate personality and i've got to keep up that personality and is that online like a separate personality does he have to keep up that personality and do you feel that's the beginning of the metaverse that's that's a great point i think exactly opposite of it right i i think like we are all living in a big boss house if you start becoming influencers and you cannot hide your true self online for a long time the more content you share the more live interactions you do you cannot hide your true self right your true self will come out and with great power it will just amplify your good or your bad will amplify right it's very much like captain america thing right the serum just brings out what you have so i think the identity will be carried over now even more to your online presence and online presence across across different platforms zuckerberg wants to take it one more level right he wants to like put a physical avatar to your digital self today i'm very sure you guys associate me on twitter or tane on twitter with a profile picture you don't even remember us but zuckerberg wants to bring it full circle he says physical we are bringing it back right so i remember it it looked quite creepy and i did this once with digital maya i don't know if you remember digital maya so i did this 3d avatar in unreal engine off myself i remember i was having fun right so zuckerberg is bringing that back and it's like a one-click thing now but now you have a physical avatar in 3d again because the conference might be taking place in arizona sure but you're in chhattisgarh true and you can't really take a flight to arizona so does it bring the world closer or does it divide the world further because everyone now creates their own bubble because even though i'm right next to say rahul who's my neighbor who drills all the time i yeah yeah he's drilling above my head all the time so now i've created a bubble where i don't want him in that world right he's noisy right but i want you right but you're not next to me right so am i sacrificing this world for the online world is that's what's happening i think yes no and that's that's where you know clubhouse twitter spaces or any online thing is happening wherein you're creating your scenes i'm sorry where you're creating your own community right and you are hanging out with people you like to hang out right just because uh just because there's a physical space constraint or because you can't travel to some place or or be there you shouldn't be constrained your your growth your your circle your network so i think it's a great thing to have isn't it interesting so tell me the technical implementation of this okay so we understand that you've got to wear a vr headset right so firstly is it going to be in vr or ar what is the difference so the way i see this entire metaverse thing happening is wherein you know you will have vr you will have ar and you will have physical as well right uh all three things would come together so you will have most of your time in in vr or on your computer screen some somewhere you will have this cup right here the cup you which you have you will take this cup to your uh to your vr as well using ar right and at the same time you will have meetups or things like that in physical spaces as well wherein you go and meet the right the real person behind it so meta versus somewhere where you have all these three dimensions you know completely virtual virtual plus physical and physical dimensions coming together yeah i think you know my personal belief on this because i was actually one of the first people in the country to ever own a vr like a commercial vr headset right right i bought it before anyone else did i bought the htc vive the original i shipped it from the us to india because we're not delivering to india it was life changing it was like there's so much that can be done with this true i realized the benefits of vr a long time ago and it's just gotten better and cheaper right that's a headset now which is like three or four times better the resolution per eye is like much better it's now 40 000 rupees on amazon right the quest to it do you want quest to i am getting it from u.s right now you can get in on amazon by the way no us no amazon is cheaper us will pay customs you know someone is coming that way cool so my big problem with vr usage is that people use it very religiously for a week and there's completely stopped right i think the immersion is a con rather than a pro it transports you into another world but people still want to be connected to this world right so that's why i feel ar might be the better technology in the long term and even mark zuckerberg said this in the um in his speech right where he copied our company name so he was he said that you know i think the ideal use case of ar or or the metaverse will be in ar where you're part of the real world but you can see your friend also right reality is a shared illusion so what happens if you and i agree that there's a pikachu there right then it becomes real essentially pikachu and you will also say i also want to speak at you right so i think ar will be where the magic's at vr is good it'll be for immersive experience i'm not convinced anybody uses vr on an everyday basis for a long period of time i think i think there is also this network perspective to it right like your network is not hanging out on the vr every day why like think of skype skype existed way before we started doing whatsapp video calls but whatsapp video call is what made video calls i like an everyday phenomena like you started talking to your parents to everyone but i don't think it's because of network effects i'll tell you why people existed on skype the problem is mobile is just too easy so maybe what you're trying to say and what i'm trying to get out of this is the current incarnation of vr is like a version one yep but you're saying it's going to become as small as a glass you're going to wear it and it's going to replace your mobile phone because the minute you replace a mobile phone that's a new platform dude this uh iwatch right i have stopped using phone because of this a lot of times i put my phone somewhere because i know if a call comes i can take it i can see what's happening do you do this so i do sometimes i do actually so now it has become an integral part because now i don't have to pull my phone from my pocket in my hand and it sounds very privileged but it is true because you know the more you make technology easier to access the more it becomes part of your everyday life right yeah for vr to reach like super mainstream adoption it's got to become glasses eventually it's going to go connect right to the optic nerve right actually i don't know the anatomy of the eye i'm not very familiar with that so i don't know if it's the optic nerve that transmits information to your brain or what it is but it's going to go there it's going to reside there key boss yeah information bezos so i am not surprised if one day we wake up and they infuse particles directly here so whenever you want to turn on vr mode you just tap here and there's one crazy gentleman who's actually you know trying to do this and that's elon musk by the way what neuralink does has always existed we've got these machines we've got the emotiv which is basically an eeg something like this is the precursor of putting your phone in your brain if you break down identity you've got the limbic system right we've got the prefrontal cortex prefrontal cortex is new dynamic system is like i want food i want reproduction etc etc i'm using the word reproduction rather than sex and the prefrontal cortex justifies all those decisions with like fancy words right i want you know a mate that does this is it but actually you're you're playing to the tune of your limbic system right so elon musk says that boss this is a tertiary system this is a third system okay that you're connecting to your brain the phone is already a third system exactly every piece of information do people hate you do people like you why do you react when people on you on the comments which you guys should do with danielle yeah please just he like he enjoys it so that feeds from your phone because you're going to read that directly into your brain which is going to into your prefrontal cortex directly into your limbic system right so limit system is going to be like society hates me i am feeling relegated i might be eaten by a tiger now because i'm separated right so i don't know what the second order effects of a system like this are i would like you to tell me i think anyway reality is an illusion i think you covered it really well right at the same time any technology new or old takes time for adoption true so in what we can't predict future at least not now we can only see where things are moving so things are moving more virtual whether it's vr or some kind of virtual reality we are moving towards it already and hardware is always going to catch up hardware will never be there and you will you will you will arrive with software software will always be in the front right so i think in 10 to 15 years we'll find out where we have to go and what we have to need vr might not be the answer ar might not be the answer but some hybrid but somehow something new something which should cut the borders and make the world more flat so that you start hanging out with people who you like instead of hanging out with people just because of physical constraints that is for sure gonna happen no matter how it happens okay there's a category or a class of people i call them luddites okay i don't know if you know what the word means but you guys can google that luddites i don't know if i'm pronouncing it right l-u-d-d-i-d-e-s these are people who say enjoy nature why do you need vr or ar or mobile phones or computer yeah right why do you need any of that right right what do you have to say to them because they are against vr they say we're creating a crazy world to them i would say is nature real or is any of your experience real simulation game it is it is what is real in life nothing is what we what we experience in any point of time we think it's reality but is that reality we don't know nobody knows so if we know that nothing is real nothing is final and whatever we experience is what we want to experience then why don't we want to experience better things but people prefer a tormented nature rather than a nature created by man because in on in vr it's a nature created by man yep so people sometimes want the real nature again real is what we too agree if you agree there's a pikachu then pikachu is there right so i think i think it's a very constrained thinking that and and and this comes from mythology and everywhere else and all of this right philosophy or futuristic thinking both agree to one thing is reality is what we want to make of it right so my thinking is why do we want to make a reality where we suffer no i agree with that i've always found it senseless how most of humanity suffers by the way and i've always found it interesting that humans are every device we create right we can call it entertainment but what we're really doing is elevating suffering exactly we're saying that when we entertain when we watch a movie we're escaping from life's troubles and when we enter we are we're truly escaping life's troubles we're resetting our life i never felt like i fit in i was very introverted i had different goals in life and i was like i wish i could transport myself away from here and i feel finally that opportunity exists for people who want to reset want to start over and for people who like the real world don't impose your claims on the other people exactly you live your reality like for example again and i'm saying this publicly i can't believe it business is rubbish most of business is rubbish it's like make believe right okay it's the same as in vr there's a pikachu same thing we agreed as a contract when we do this whatever right so it's not much different from the existing world it's just you have to be adaptable to understand that that world exists right and you are outnumbered because of the way math works a parent usually has two kids and both those kids are going to be part of this generation so parents are out number two is to one right even though they're two parents the kids are going to have two more kids and then that number gets skewed right so the next generation will outnumber you like i think some huge percentage of india's population is under 30 working class and they all understand how to use a computer how to use a phone right and they're all going to be part of this new world so tane where are the opportunities i think the opportunities are in first understanding how this all of all of this is going to work if you become a an anti-vr anti-metaversity person i think just shut your eyes the world is not going to change it's going to move where it's going to move and you can't change it the world is moving towards because we have done with our survival needs right we want more and more facts so you're saying humanity as a whole has ascended through the maslow's pyramid we've gone up right the entirety of humanity what are the people at the bottom they're still struggling for survival and stuff why are we abandoning them i think we are not abandoning them uh once we start realizing that you know everything has taken time to trickle down even this will take some time to trickle down right got it we are not dying like the bottom half is not dying with this uh from the same disease more diabetes than starvation exactly you have to be open to it first of all is what i would say second is i think this will be a world of builders right you cannot uh you cannot not be a builder not be a critical thinking person not be a creative person and and thrive in this world because you have to be a creator now i'm not saying content creator see my other video where i got belted for that but my channel yeah on on varun's channel because i get more belted on his channel than on my whole channel right so so i am not saying you have to be a content creator but you have to be a creator of some sim programming some kind some something has to come in creating either content or design or something you know code i think i think these are three segments right content design code product human understanding you can do a lot i think that that comes with similar segments somewhere between design and writing products so you have to have one skill one definitive skill of you know design creativity uh maybe communication what happens otherwise do you be do you stay on the consumer side if you if you can't create anything i think what happens on the other side would be lovely to see it's the same thing which we are talking which we were talking about few years back around upi right the universal income around a i like if ai solves all of our words ubi universal basic income right so if you ai solves all our problems what happens to the bottom half or the lower half so that's already happening right if we if you see a lot of jobs have been replaced by automation and people have been pushed towards more creative pursuit right now a lot of people are into programming or design than before and they are having better work better deep work and more fulfillment from life so the way i see it is and i make machines do all the work work do they make machines do all the work and all all the smart people everybody will become smarter more creative and because they have time to educate themselves now because they're not doing childhood exactly exactly so craftsmanship will be there more and then you will have a more fulfilled life is what i'm sure what i'm saying true so i personally believe that the opportunity and i've said this like a million times i did a course on this like a year-long course on this learn the unreal engine or learn unity yeah i think boss this is not going to be like old school apps right i know tana is like a champion at microsoft of old apps but i think the world's moving into 3d games so i think 3d design definitely has a very strong 3d which is blender i'm telling you blender is going to be the reason blender is getting so popular even though three or four four years ago the industry was popular maya was popular in the industry it's a 3d modeling tool right blenders weren't popular because it was free and open source in fact i feel like the tools itself have a meta verse among themselves you can take something in blender send it to unreal take something in unreal senator maya take something maya you know make a video out of it it's crazy you can just like pop tools from here to there i mean pop assets from here to there among the tools right right and they've all created something called bridges i think the other third thing which i would say is crypto but not cryptocurrency but cryptography right the identity uh and the sanctity of identity maintained across across platforms across devices will come from cryptography and it has been there right we are using https for so long it's cryptography right so i think understanding of these three things would be crucial a very less like two percent of cryptography i think uh 20 30 percent of design and a lot bigger programming some sort maybe we don't even have to write code anymore for program we will think of something else a no code tool also a programming tool right what about uh what about me being a content creator in vr i take a video of a scene and then play it for others why is that not a good career option i don't know i haven't thought about it so i'll tell you why it's not a good career option happens on twitch all the time there are billion people doing it one person's successful exactly the same odds as in the current content creator space billions of indians trying five people who have more than ten thousand not five obviously much more than that but very few number of people with more than ten thousand or hundred thousand followers how many you can count them on their fingers right odds of winning are very low because the barrier of entry is low it's also a zero sum right because attention is limited yeah end of the day you're in attention game not making code right yeah with code even if somebody else has the attention you can give your skills to them with content you can't do that right you can't create content and donate your views to another person it doesn't happen right right very difficult so that's it yeah that's it so guys metaverse watch out for it and yeah comments yes please bye make sure you like subscribe and follow this channel bye"}

{"video_id": "wzBDMflT1YA", "title": "Hacking Neuroscience to be Happy", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzBDMflT1YA", "transcript": "so one of the easiest ways to be happy is to be in a state of flow now there's this old book called flow the psychology of optimal experience or flow the secret of happiness now I don't want to pronounce the author's name I know his first name it's me Holly but his last name is almost impossible to pronounce I'm not gonna embarrass myself or you know injustice to the author but the book is about how you know the happiest people are often the ones that are in flow which is they're working on a task that they're very comfortable with and I wanted to talk a little bit about flow in this podcast one of the reasons most people suffer and feel frustrated is because they can't get themselves to think the thoughts they always want to so one thing you realize if you just close your eyes and just sat down is that you really can't control your stream of thoughts right you just have to let them flow and let them do their thing and any you know attempt at trying to change your thoughts actively is just gonna lead to resentment and frustration and you know if you want to try this out just don't think of a white elephant for the next 30 seconds all right it's it's harder than it seems and the reason for this is because most people don't realize that there are two brains inside you right there's the prefrontal cortex which is the seat of intelligence it's the one that evolved very recently and then there's the limbic system which is the older brain which is the monkey brain I like to call it the monkey brain because it's like in my opinion it's like having a pet in there and the sooner you realize that there are two different brains and you the rationalizing brain the prefrontal cortex have to deal with the the older brain and basically you're in service of that older brain right and whether you know it or not every decision you make every rational decision you make is just serving some the needs of your limbic system or your monkey brain and the right way to treat that brain is to treat it exactly how you treat any other pet if you had a dog and a lot of people are great owners of dogs right the tree talks very well but they don't treat their monkey butt in the same way right they reprimanded they punish it they hug you with it they trap it but the right way to kind of really treat the limbic system or the monkey brain is to treat it like any other pet the treated like you treat a good pet right which is treated with respect if it's barking or if it's you know being loud unusually loud then you just ignore it remember when your dogs barking you don't go and reprimand and say why are you barking instead you just ignore it for a bit and the dog will just eventually stop barking because it's not getting in your attention so you need to learn how to ignore your your older brain and it seems counterintuitive to think that there are two brains inside you but they truly are right that it's two very separate systems and you know I've held the human brain in my hand and I already knew that there were two separate systems but when you hold the real human brain in your hand and you know I had the opportunity to the Sydenham hand some time ago you realize that's no actual physical separation between these two now parts of the brain it's just like a natural extension of natural evolution so you know biology is complex and looking at it play out in behavior that's even more exciting to watch but one of the most important ways to manage your your monkey brain apart from you know ignoring it when it when it gets too loud or you know giving it what it wants once in a while one of the best ways to kind of work with the monkey brain is to allow it to play dogs function very very well if you allow them to play exercise is healthy right but more important then exercise is the fact that you need to keep the dog occupied similarly you need to keep the monkey brain occupied and one of the best ways to keep the monkey brain occupied is to teach at some skill right whether that we design or or football or anything it could be absolutely anything even playing an instrument make sure that the dog has or the monkey brain has a certain degree of control or a certain degree of skill at that particular task and then eventually allow it to play which is to go ahead and you know just free play right just you imagine you're you're playing a video game and you're just put in the middle of the video game with with a controller and you can do whatever you want in free training or practice mode that is flow right and you know the book obviously goes all over the place and talks about flow in many different ways but in short it's about letting your monkey brain play and when your monkey brain plays the other part of your brain which is the prefrontal cortex some people call it the default mode network psychologists like to use that word the default mode network which is you know the seat of not just intelligence but also of anxiety and depression that shuts off for a bit as the monkey brain plays so the goal is to get the monkey brain to come out and do its thing while the newer brain the more rational brain takes a break and just chills out and that is how you stay happy"}

{"video_id": "lBbDaCNIKTg", "title": "How we wrote a #1 Amazon business bestseller - Part 2", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBbDaCNIKTg", "transcript": "yes so before you watch this video go check out part 1 of this video which is on Abydos channel the link is in the description below and on this screen so go check out this video first and then come to this video when we discuss how we work from nowhere to one number one best seller on Amazon I think the biggest challenge for me was you know focusing on the book especially in those periods the troughs right you know and then I stopped reading the book and go back to doing my normal work that was remember the book was psychotic I am still running and when I go back to normal work a couple of weeks I come back some change and then I get back in the focus also I think the context which was really I was doing multiple things and going back to something that you I am I have to be true like the attack go to the point where I going to be writing they don't remember what my clothes thought at that point was so just to get that both are accurate we we have again started to hook more times I haven't read the book after it's like publishing thing I don't you ready right now I read it and then I was in it I know I'm sure we'd already know this yeah I think the biggest challenge for me was since this was the first book I talked about this already but it was the fact that I knew I was gonna promote it and I was like I know my friends to be like oh so coolly did this and then it's a book this is really bad they're like what is it again and this is going to be final on people I would have a charge to change it what things would be like I was just like going through it Oh big through each one few times then you know our images need work he's not formatted right even once a time excited and send it back a lot of things I was like okay like as this needs to be changed they might have done this but other no we need to change this they said in Chinese we like that and but it was small stuff and I will remember but really kept asking us for all the copyrights for all the images so idol image well it was me and my co-founders and someone the book in the ending beautiful story but at that point you know who they said you need coefficient from all the four people in this image I was like okay and I you know these are my co-founders it took some time you know they were all doing their own thing and then you know I finally got their permission so every image in the book there are either permissions or it's create fire but then we also have a like of work we made up work well that you know can we use this they go sometime goodbye all those software just in trucks we have actually men is not me something I didn't know you know picture something but when you do it with like a publishing company and emails source has to be like a verified so they have to give you like and in writing you are allowed to use this okay so now this well done we had a final version this time it was actually finally you know it was semi final one just before this and then it was final now that this was our waiver like okay we could reach for a sec but let's start dining relaunch I thinking we call you fail it's wonderful team great so we got a few people they told us look we have you know some Facebook promotions and already has an audience we promoted it to our own audience wedding obviously publishing date I think is remaining awesome this July so again yes my diamonds my diamonds are forward and in July it wasn't me it was on the stands you able to buy it in bookstores but just before that I think we discussed marketing plan we did in an Instagram pic oh they loved that the audience of that we just show them on the life of entrepreneurs like we also did a lot of my students here and here's how you do press co-worker we work with the publisher right because luckily only do all these guys are so we got rest meeting we got wrestling technician we got dressing we got arrested I think Bangalore Mirror or any more Mumbai man or something so we got present all these places with this canal from Google's very keen is very well connected is just a you don't have a chart with this genuine and you know we have a chat and then we like stories but because publishing book on my home I will coordinate the publishers as well so I hope you do my channel where you can actually go and you see how to holding it anybody especially the press so take a look at that's being any technique but you know it's it's important for you to get in front of the press figure without the best you don't have the paper right mean you don't have those organic ways what do you what do you think was the start for us for building personal friends like at this point we already have personal brands to some level because it's freelancing it's a great way to get project wait wait we even get a job you're up there on the Internet but for this book we needed to do certain things right now we're doing YouTube we're doing Instagram where do you think this already I think we started with that video a craft or hobby each and every day like false so that videos talking about this is already Chinese senior editor false because you know google it or me to make some video content that's amazing I said let me do that so we made one video about that and then you know I got some traction close it up people love the content like this is content we've never seen in our lives and if you go to Abuelo's channel or my channel you will see that some this content is amazing I actual technical advice not just though you can do it motivational stuff we're tired of that I'm sure you guys it's actually tactical stuff and you know the minute we started doing that I realized that you have you better person under this because I start getting subscribers same a lot of people actually want to listen to us and it's I don't know if it's it's just a thing right you feel like a boss to be like am I really good enough for out this market but then when you think about that way the edges published book is published in the world publishing it running the commodity million dollar company I've noticed this you've seen your designer and Academy at that point so like maybe you know is good enough to write a book about this or to build a personal brand think about this right we read a lot of books one last time unity and then after I had applied this one more part of the CEO court a although was a role I know that can you be my mentor yeah ignore me for a few weeks but I get persistently following up about acid because now with our Instagram like we see this we approach stories every day working aging with this community and to me this was just a natural extension of the book if the book we're trying to say something it's one way to discussion it's a one-way discussion it's for everybody to read but not on small validation that happening every day one its generic just before the visit is replying to BM state and I think that just reset the context of personal branding whatever just like I don't really have to do something you know not just make a logo and start putting out it would just what people are reading this book they're enjoying it and they wanna have a conversation with the person who wrote it and that's very interesting I mean once we started to make that on Instagram we strive like this on youtube you like you know some of the things will touch the one on the book can be really good visual essays when you talk about on our channels which is why we start with you with I think the reason we did on YouTube Instagram and not medium or like I think people are tired of decks next is annoying just you just already readings nominal everyday basis for video content is refreshing and the world is moving to video so we talked a video for anybody else in the car it's not it's not a strange concept when you're bouncing numeric or three particular still a video for another continent it's a small industry right and we're just getting started I think the very very few people doing this in India whatever you guys might have is how are you how much money you be so you can talk about the oil is actually so you get 10% of every sale made right regardless of whether it's a physical version or another Kim this is the capability we get like when effect or I don't know the exact numbers I think it's somewhere between ten twenty five percent if you make a clearance sale where they can be make an offline sale or like something on Amazon that's ten percent so that's not money even if you do the math even if they sell like hundreds of thousands of copies that so much I mean is pretty standard if you are writing a book you can't wait to go share it if you want but if you just think about it it's you the publisher then this massive distribution network God so 10% you know who's leaving fifty percent of that goes to just distribution and logistics yeah but I guess that's the trade-off you make when you work with a big publisher you have to put initially by a one you because they have all these channels I get to go see if you self publish we're about maybe you know hundred five hundred sales start announced a will go through the app distribution network write the books in Gwalior the books in bookstores in Bangalore in in Delhi in at airports so that's the beauty of having somebody like those very obviously you know they you will make very little money but it doesn't matter you don't write a book to make money write a book to build a personal life right that's the only reason you should write a book so this person you said right there we will do the first authors or one of you first few authors to be having more discussions with people very good book so we will read the book they'll ask us questions after work on our DMS and we'd actually answer those questions and this point we're also putting a lot of video content in saying you know on specific possible profit which is getting our questions on so we just I extended that the movies you know conversations with particular people just say you know me Google is exact Saudis or you just say guys we're giving away books if you do the sector they eventually you know a lot of people are cliquey copies and you know movie itself you've got these two the result and you're just a you know here's seriously how can you do it in a lot of interviews very good interviews so we could with all these themes and then a lot of people like Laurie who wanted are tiny but it was just too busy they were like if I buy the book it's a ticket to getting a one-on-one session with the author it was actually like that so a lot of people buy the book we read through the black but another question on this spot and I'd actually the time ago on so because here they've taken the time of the raid something that I put up and we start doing giveaways and you know when we were doing this giveaways somehow we realize that we have a number fourteen on the Amazon bestseller is right and this is what and missus the position communications bestsellers we did a number book in there and there was like a race so I picked up my phone and I said because you know this is a penis what do you think we do number one right and you will not believe at like five thousand engaged followers of another has another four thousand thousand emails followers maybe another thousand subscribers on YouTube they are one by six case of smaller bridge but we suggest is the race okay there are so many books from that one 213 bridge can we meet them and you will not believe it it really matter if you solve become a team effort right so you know we went from 14 to 12 you know and we were at for a while and you know like your body onions you will not believe some of our fans also biting my nails so I p.m. to people saying you know I'm watching it live I'm refreshing it every five minutes openly reaches number one and people just are coming up selfies with the book where like you know go support this book go buy it being like an entire team effort we got the community model and you know I was we were expecting you to take will be equal to the weeks before this campaign worked out the campaign was if pajama which is number one I will give away some portion of my library to a few people right one day I'm going to be know that when I was like you $2.99 and I said you know let's let's try to get it from them about that's a goal to achieve and I'm gonna you know you were talking me in the clear in the morning what was it like yeah all right with these things sensible all happening on Instagram like even my story it was like 6 p.m. 8 p.m. 9 p.m. right it was just like building up everybody was things happened and I did we we people reading anything like notification just went up so that's when I knew something was happening and I was a week so that's when you called it out like okay this happen soon as I expected as you could monitor boy you know like she's not is it till that point we started to lose the campaign it'll be like three or four weeks we just stagnated if we're going to be number fourteen to number fifty were swinging back for at some point we reach number one twenty or something well that those sixteen are just it was a community driven effort we want to get everybody engaged friend like the team effort and we have number one and you're asking what it feels like to be number one it doesn't feel that today like it felt really good for two seconds when I spoke up enemy number I was like this means normal to do yeah like what's next because now that you have one what do you do with it and then that makes it a large part of this video which is what is the future popjam problem what are we going to do with it so you know what empty feeling unit number one that I just felt empty I said okay now let me reach that you've got with the top but that one I realized you know journey that mattered most we really like the joke we like the community effort so I'm going to be replicating same thing on a much larger scale on the Internet I'm building a completely free online open-source NBA alternative like business from scratch to finish from how do you raise a seed round to how you do cold calls who are you cellular phone right all agree make the entire process because I have been through it once before the party someone give that information out for free inserting 100% sleep I'm just building this huge community of really nice orders and I'm not interested in like putting up pictures of you know what I ate for breakfast and of the Great Lakes that's not engaged objects I will engage audience that really cares for what I am doing and I should care about what they're doing is well and I need so far that's happening the next chapter of this journey is going to be on YouTube when I start going on I have 10 K disciples my goal with my channel is to create 10,000 new design over the next couple of years and with book this was possible but it's really hard to do with you do massive each massive engagement you can directly talk to us we're going to be creating new communities online following with which you get an alternative paths that you probably didn't know existed before and you get to do this with other like-minded individuals we're just as passionate about doing something by themselves as you are that's just something that we have you know that's the future plan I guess and obviously a profit so that's my main focus but this is all things this is my side problem and my psychology should help people have an alternate interior this way better than just going to work it contain equality so guys that's it for us you know if you like the content if you want to learn more about you know how the quality means not reach out to different people how to

{"video_id": "iaoTQTWF940", "title": "HOW MUCH CAPITAL DO YOU NEED TO STARTUP | METASTARTUP #4", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaoTQTWF940", "transcript": "and so now that you decided to start a company we're gonna talk about the first most important topic that I want to tackle which is raising the capital for it now you might be thinking here just start a company where am I gonna raise capital from and the answer to that is you're gonna raise capital from yourself and people around you so this video is called marking off the capital and I'm going to define the rough capital estimates to run your company for 18 months just like if you were going to college you need to mark out enough capital and enough time to be able to be successful in my opinion anywhere between 10 to 20 lakhs and 18 months of time is the perfect amount to run any generic software startup if your startup requires a little more capital which is buying some equipment or doing some research and development or buying things in bulk then your capital requirements might be higher this 10 to 20 lakhs assumes that you're only going to be hiring anywhere between one and two people and both co-founders don't take a salary for 18 months in these 18 months we'll talk about the milestones required in a future episode to raise your future round of capital or better yet be profitable now a lot of you are probably thinking to yourself where am I going to get 10 to 20 lakhs from and the answer to this is that even if you go for a master's today it would cost you roughly about the same amount if you went somewhere abroad the new masters gonna cost you even more why would he spend so much on a masters when you're not even willing to spend that much on a real life business experience which is just running a start-up it confuses me that a lot of people would go abroad to learn business while they can use the same amount of capital to try pulling off that business by themselves I mean you will gain way more experience running a business on your own than reading anything about it I mean the experience of having hired people going through the daily grind sitting out there in the trenches trying to get your first customer is way more valuable than going to business school and learning from other people's experiences the entire point of this course is to arm you with enough knowledge for free so that they are able to pull off a star on your own without having to go to these schools so you watching this video means you can actually take the same 10 or 20 lakhs that you were gonna invest in business school to run your own startup now you can also run your startup in a much smaller amount of capital but there's an emotional cost to going back and raising more capital from your parents or your friends or your relatives or whatever it not just distracts you it also causes a loss of confidence from your parents and relatives and whoever because they're seen you come back for capital multiple times instead it's better to go and ask for a large chunk of money keep that money in the bank and use it wisely in one shot that's it for this video I just wanted to talk about the amount of capital you need to keep aside in the next video we're gonna talk about naming your company"}

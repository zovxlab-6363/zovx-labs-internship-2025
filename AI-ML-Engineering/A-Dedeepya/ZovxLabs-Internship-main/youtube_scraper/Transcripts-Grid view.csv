O_1ljm8YHY8,Why Adobe Global CEO Says Creativity Will Be India's Next IT Boom!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_1ljm8YHY8,"Photoshop right The flagship has been around for so long We wouldnt be able to exist without Photoshop We do so much creative work today What s the secret behind the longevity You build products for yourselves And you know I think if you have a creative community and a DNA within the company I think in many ways you know the most the sternest critics are yourselves How does one get into the position of being CEO of Adobe I was the last man standing What is the career path to be where you re at You know what has that journey been like for you personally If I go back really a long way around I wanted to be a journalist growing up I did not want to be CEO I just wanted to build great products I saw that you had recently said that in India creativity might be the next IT boom I want to know more about your thesis on on the creativity versus IT piece We have the saying at Adobe where everybody has a story to tell How do you not piss off like an entire legion of artists by going overly generative but also how do you continue to stay relevant Because if you don t do that somebody else will counter position and say Well were the generative only suite If you use the Firefly models we said were the company that has to respect and champion the intellectual property rights of the creative professionals When when did you know you were going to be CEO Like what was that moment like Well you know I ladies and gentlemen I am with the Adobe Global Chair and CEO Shantanu Narayan Shantu its an absolute honor to do this Its uh kind of been you know I ve been using Adobe tools since since before I knew what I was doing in life right One of the first exposures to an Adobe tool I had was maybe CS5 or CS6 And at that time you know if you wanted to make a website you d have to use the slicing tool Youd have to have an image You have to slice it up And since then you know the standards have changed Since then the ways you make a website have changed The ways you do design have changed Tools have come tools have gone I would have bet a lot because I was very bullish on you know on on the internet when I was very young I would I was very bullish on the idea that at some point there will be somebody that comes and does what Adobe does in the cloud and does that better But somehow Photoshop right the flagship has been around for so long And before I get into anything I just want to know the secret of this longevity right We wouldnt be able to exist without Photoshop We do so much creative work today What's the secret behind the longevity Well first Vun its a pleasure to be on your show and thank you for being a creative Uh its always fun to hear stories about people whose lives have changed as a result of pursuing creative endeavors something that as you can imagine we have a tremendous passion for I think as it relates to you know building products uh you know I think there are a couple of lessons I ve learned The first is you build products for yourselves And you know I think if you have a creative community and a DNA within the company I think in many ways uh you know the most the sternest critics are yourselves and so were I think always trying to say you know uh how do we build products that you know delight us and uh become more affordable accessible uh uh but you're being kind also I mean you know I think as all good companies we're probably more self-critical of the things that we haven't done right Uh we've certainly done some things right and um you know its just its a constant endeavor. And do you feel like working on desktop apps because I ve heard from a lot of people right working on desktops apps especially in this era its pretty difficult because you re working with something that s legacy thats been built a long time ago You re probably rebuilding parts of it as you go Is it harder to do than lets say building something in the cloud if you're doing it from scratch Well we don t think of it as desktop apps and cloud or mobile I mean I think we think of it a lot more as surfaces and you know when uh all of these tectonic technology shifts happen you know I when the move uh to a mobile device happened you know one of the assertions we made was mobile devices shouldnt just be consumption devices they should be creation devices when we saw the cloud we looked at it and said why should you be tethered to a computer inspiration strikes at many uh times and so you should do it So I you know I I think we uh are constantly thinking about what surface provides what value and are you taking advantage of the surface Uh many times I think you unfortunately try to uh retrofit what works well in one surface and another surface and you fail and so you know I I I think we tend to think of it as the web affords friction free usage of technology mobile allows you you know a different kind of a screen factor and and ease of use and and speed at doing things Uh but the desktop I think has continued and the PC frankly has continued to be the place where most people would say they re the most productive and they re the most efficient And so take advantage of all the surfaces because at the end of the day, that allows us to target and deal with more customers No that makes sense Um Chanta I want to know how does one get into the position of being CEO of Adobe Like what is it What I was the last man standing What is the career path to be where you re at And you know what has that journey been like for you personally You know I if I go back really a long way Vun I wanted to be a journalist growing up Um you know I I was always fascinated by writing and um the first ever job which as you know uh at least in the 80s when I grew up in India um you didn't really have summer jobs and you didnt have internships but um I apprenticed at you know a newspaper doing copywriting So you know journalism was always important to me. Um and now vicariously I m still part of the publishing industry but um my professional journey I I ve worked for all companies that I think have a creative DNA in them. I was at Apple for many years when Jurassic Park came out I worked for Silicon Graphics I started my own company So like you Im an entrepreneur Uh unlike you I was a failed entrepreneur at what I did Uh a company I think everyone goes through enough like a bunch of failures before it works uh a company called Pictra I say the best thing that happened to me because that brought me to Adobe and Pictures on the web U you know in the early 9s I felt like that social connection would be important. And then I came to Adobe because I looked at it and I said Oh my god look at the franchise that Adobe had  And Adobe was actually uh in conversations to potentially acquire picture The deal didn't happen And I said you know when I think about the brand of Photoshop and the brand of Illustrator and Acrobat, it was something that really resonated with me and um I was lucky enough uh to be recruited there. You know, my journey at Adobe changed dramatically over the years. Uh but the core genesis I think was that I'm you know maybe at my core I care about design. I care about creativity. I care about expression and you know Adobe is the ultimate privilege to be able to work for it. I did not want to be CEO when I came. It wasn't you know there are some people who are early enough in their life they know I want to be this particular role. I just wanted to build great products. You know what was your role like entering the company? I was called a VPG GM uh you know of uh one of the groups. I mean you mentioned that you're spending more time doing P&Ls. You know, everybody tends to think that being a GM, you know, you've sort of arrived. Uh, but funnily, I joined as a GM. The company hit a wall uh 6 months later and we laid off uh something like 25% of the company. This was in 1998 and u they then asked me to actually take over inesign. Inesign was this naent project. They said, ""Hey, you're a technologist."" They completely reorganized to be functional. So I was no longer a general manager. I was an engineering uh lead for the layout products. Um and then 6 months later I think you know we shipped in design in design luckily one and then they asked me to run all engineering. So you know the path uh and career paths and I think even for your listeners they take different routes but I think uh if you can always think about where you add value and the value that needed to be added at that point was getting in design out of the door and you know we're at our core a product company and so and being able to run all products was a privilege. When when did you know you were going to be CEO? Like what was that moment like? Well, you know, I as I said, I joined in 98. By 99, I was running all engineering. By 2001, I was promoted to run all products. And you know, at some point there along the way, you're like, ""Oh, oh my god, maybe, you know, I will have the opportunity to run the company."" And in 2005, I got promoted to be president and chief operating officer. And that felt more real at that point. But then we acquired macro media and you know the integration took a little while. Um but you know when the two founders uh who unfortunately have both passed you know both brilliant brilliant brilliant people John Waro and Chuck Gashki when they told me that the board had decided that I would be the next CEO. I mean professionally without a doubt um it was the most you know honor that I've received in my career and something that I cherish to this day. That's a crazy story. You know, in our own company now, we do thousands of videos a month. We never thought we'd get to this scale, right? And generative has really been the backbone. Everything from avatars to just the micro advantages you get from using generative, right? It could be as simple as generative fill. Extend the frame, right? It's just so many small things that have really made our life easier. We do content for 10 of our own channels, 40 client channels. Um and you know it's almost like in India for content we've kind of become the port of first call but we never imagined such a large opportunity to be there here right and we can see now that there's no end to where the opportunity is right and I saw that you had recently said that in India creativity might be the next IT boom right I've started to believe it but it's very hard to get the average person to believe this right because they're like well it has been around for a very very long time and creativity well it still feels like India would be you know India's not there on the global stage yet but I think generative really fills that gap. Uh I want to know more about your thesis on on on the creativity versus IT piece. Well, you know it's I think it's true across so many dimensions, right? I mean the first thing is you know we have this saying at Adobe where everybody has a story to tell and so if you think about the fact that everybody has a story to tell and they want to tell their story at the end of the day that's in a way your addressable market for the world, right? Um if you think about education and why is it in this day and age that education is still about writing rather than you know animating or having videos or uh you know being able to express yourself graphically. Um when you think about any commerce business right now a commerce business is basically about an experience and the person who creates the best experience is going to be the one that wins. So you know if you decompose what creativity really means uh as a part of every industry right uh as well as this fundamental social need I mean why have the social networks really exploded it's because people fundamentally have a need to interact in a way that's unique and personal to them. So that's why I'm a big believer that at the end of the day, creativity is uh you know one of those fundamental uh social desires that are going that are going to create massive markets. Now how you decide what component of each of these other businesses is as a result of creativity versus is commerce really creativity? I tend to think it is right and it plays a role. uh but that so I think it's the lens by which we approach it allows us as a company to then think about oh my god if we have this big opportunity are we capitalizing on the opportunity I think in many ways when companies scale it's not that they suddenly wake up one morning and you know the market has grown it's you're changing the aperture by which you look at the opportunity I mean when you were talking about it you know whether it's the channel that you run versus a channel for a company versus a channel. So I I think that's how we're trying to expand you know how we think about creativity. And you know when I went to Waves and you you gave a keynote at Waves as well, right? Like if you the minute you landed in Mumbai to the point where you were at the event, it was plastered with like billboards on Waves and audio video communication. It if if I was Adobe I would be like dancing, right? I would be like great like everyone's woken up. I was so surprised to see a the spends b the kind of you know time energy and attention that the government is now giving you know things like creativity I think they're very bullish that this could be the next you know sort of it-esque industry u do you have a sense of how many more jobs could be created here maybe not tangible numbers but just you know what how you see this volume expand is it a training thing is it a you know if you were to architect this how would you do it well I think first it it starts with education and it starts with accessibility I you know the story that's often told about how somebody left a computer you know unattended in a small village in India and how you know people just embrace it. So I I think the first thing is accessible and I think with mobile devices and PCs it's just going to become more accessible which I think is great uh because when you have accessibility you know I I think you foster opportunity u I think the second thing is uh you know inspiration. So if you have accessibility, you want to be inspired, right? And I think if there are two things that inspire people in this country, at least maybe there's a little bit of a, you know, cliche, but it's sports and cricket and it's films, right? And both of them are, you know, are inherently also experiences that you do. And so I don't know that I have a number. I know it's big. I mean, we have aspirations to even in the education market, you know, find two crores of people. And how do you it used to be reading, writing, and arithmetic when I grew up were the three skills that people said were the way to improve your lot. Why isn't it reading, writing, arithmetic, and digital literacy with creativity a fundamental part of that? So if you think about it that way, then every single student with this skill now has an opportunity if you're a small and be small business, if you're a person working in the creative. So I I think it's unlimited. Now how much of that then translates into economic you know GDP and the growth associated with that? I think that's work ahead of us. But I what I was really impressed with what the government was doing was to say hey this is just one of those fundamental things that if we do right you know we're going to foster a new generation. I know they've always been enamored with the animation industry and the graphics industry. The publishing industry still in India is probably the most lucrative publishing industry in the world. Right. And so I I but I think it solves these fundamental issues of education, of opportunity. And so I I think it's immense. Yeah. Um I have a question around generative AI and this is a I often say that somebody's asking me this the other day and I and I said that it's kind of a tough spot to be in Adobe's like shoes right now mainly because there's two clear audiences here, right? Or or maybe that's the general subset of two audiences. one who will adopt everything that everything new in generative AI they want it they want to speed up their workflows they probably have a lot of work on their plate and they want to move forward there's also a group of creatives that is a little bit anti-generative right and there is a line that they draw which is well generative fill is fine but if you're using you know um you know something which is completely AI generated that's a problem right so it is it's hard because you can't end up building two product suites right one with generative one without generative Um, so how do you see this? Like how do you not piss off like an entire legion of artists by going overly generative, but also how do you continue to stay relevant? Because if you don't do that, somebody else will counterposition and say, well, we're the generative only suite. I I actually think Adobe has done a phenomenal job of addressing that upfront. And part of what we talk about as a company is it's not just the technology, but it's the responsibility that we have as one of the larger companies in the space to speak on behalf of the community. So I I'll geek out for a little while. First, as it relates to our models and the models that we've created, as you know, we were the company that said we're only going to create these models based on licensed content. Very unique, very differentiated. And so if you use the Firefly models, we said we're the company that has to respect and champion the rights, the intellectual property rights of the creative professionals, which is why we do it. You know, we have Behance, as you know, it's one of the largest, if not the largest creative professional network in the world, but we did not train on that because we didn't have rights to do that. So, first we made a very strong uh, you know, statement of what we thought about intellectual property. Now, I think that appealed to the community because the community said if there's one company that's speaking up for the rights of and I think the courts will eventually have to appine on some of this stuff, but we make that stance and we actually have stuck by it. Um, I think there's so how do we think about it in terms of product strategy? To your point, we have such a wide variety of customers. consumers who want to use a product like Adobe Express, they probably don't need the flexibility of multiple models. So, they're just like, I fear the blank page. The real beauty or the benefit of generative AI is that most people when they have something that they want to create, they fear the blank page. Whereas being able to have a conversation and have that process kicked off either with a template or with a conversation enables them to, you know, uh, be more productive. So I think for that community, we've built in Firefly, we will have Express, but the fact that it's commercially safe. The consumer probably cares a little bit less about what's underlying the technology, they just want to get stuff done. The creative professional on the other hand, as you know, we started off with for generative fill or generative extend, we only had Firefly support because we were convinced that that was the right way to serve the creative community. With enterprises, you know, the largest enterprises in the world are partnering with us because they don't want their content ingested by people who don't respect intellectual property. So, we've created custom models for them. So now we also have this flexibility where if you're within Coke, you're creating a marketing campaign, you have a custom model of Firefly that has all your assets as well as Adobe's Firefly because that's also, you know, designed to be commercially safe. It's the Firefly model fine-tuned on their internal app. Exactly. Um and you do that as a service or is that Yeah, we do that as a service you know uh and the interest in that as you can imagine is immense because you know your intellectual property is your data. They don't want their data you know scraped on the internet and so that's why they do that. However, you also if you think about where creatives are using it right now, creatives have also embraced this idea of when I'm ideulating, maybe I'm okay using, you know, a model that's not designed to be commercially safe. But then later when I use it in production, I want to make sure that I use it because that's like going to an art gallery and getting inspired by a painting on the wall, you know, to to do some creative. And so at the recent Max conference we showed how you know we will support thirdparty models and that's actually come as a result of uh you know customers saying we love Adobe products support the third party model and we will differentiate between when we're using it for ideiation versus when we're using it to be uh used in production. As you know also and again I'm geeking out but in the Photoshop when you upload a picture and you say hallucinate with not just the text but in the spirit of this picture we actually ask you to testify that you have rights to that picture. So you know it's this balance that we're trying to do. We want to give flexibility. We want to serve the customers in the diverse ways in which they want to but we also want to make it clear what our northstar is of what we stand for which is you know how we stand for the intellectual property how we stand for content authenticity. We're thrilled. We have 4,000 people who've signed up to, you know, uh, be part of this content authenticity initiative where you, uh, will specify the provenence, but it's work in progress. And I think, you know, we're also a company that's smart enough to say this thing will evolve and if we don't evolve with the times, we won't be serving our customers and our prospective customers. Well, I have a a CEO question to you, right? Um so when I started a company when I started this company actually we started with creativity then we said you know we'll infuse technology in here to get scale which I think has worked out well but now I find I spend most of my time like I said you know pre this chat I spend most of my time on P&L managing people figuring out how to hire people I want to know from a time management perspective right how do you actually manage your time like what do you spend most of your time on what is top priority for you what are the messages on your on your phone that you need to like like how would you say your your time management and day management framework is? How much how much time do you spend on hiring? Like I want to know everything like and you can go you can geek out as much as you want. Well, the reality is you know what you focus on changes. You know I I I'll share with you what one of the co-founders John Waro told me when I took my job. when I first took my job, he said, ""If I don't like my job, I have one person to blame."" And in many ways, that was the most profound piece of advice that he gave me. And so, bro, what I'll tell you is you have more power to spend the time on whatever you want to spend the time on. And you know one of the things we try and do as a senior executive team every year at the beginning of the year is we say what are the two or three things that you want to do that you think will really move the needle or have impact in the company and then disproportionately spend time on that uh your demands whether they be IR investors or you know PR or whether it's product or whether it's customers it could be infinite and you know time is your most valuable commodity. So I'm actually quite thoughtful about where I am going to spend my time and where I'm not going to spend my time. And the power of a team is that you can get somebody else to do the stuff that you're either not very good at or you don't have an inclination to do. So but it changes. One year I might say I want to spend time on industry partnerships and I'm going to invest my time and energy on that. But I have that conversation with my team so that somebody else is picking up the stuff that perhaps I'm not going to be spending time on and then you trust your team to you know do the other stuff. So I that that's the advice that I would give but it changes. The one constant I would say in my job is product. At the end of the day we're a product company. If you don't build innovative great products and in many ways my role is chief product officer as well right when you're running a tech company you should be that. And so that's the constant. But otherwise I flip it around. I flip it around because I want to have fun doing the things that I want to do and and I you know dirty secret for both of us. We have the luxury of doing that. Can I ask you a question on how you communicate with your team? Do you are you very verbal about it? Do you do you do meetings or are you like I'm going to write a note and do you spend a lot of time writing those notes? Like what's your feed like how do you how do you communicate with them? You know, my philosophy on the team, we have pretty regular check-ins every Monday. So, a Monday is sort of And how big is that exactly? Six, seven people. I mean, that's the thing when people also say, ""Oh my god, you run this large company."" The liberating fact is you still have the same number of people whether the company is, you know, 5 million or the company is 5,000 or the company is 50. And, you know, it's the power of that team that helps you manage and scale and grow the company. I like email because I think it forces me to be more precise and I also find that you know when when you have a conversation with people people interpret different things and so I I I've always liked the discipline of writing it but only for important things right I mean if you have a product strategy issue or if you have something that you think the company is not doing well then I think taking the trouble to actually write it pays off in spades but otherwise you know we have meetings it's a very open flow we call it roundt and the roundt idea is whatever's top of mind I mean in many ways I also m view my role as removing obstacles and so I have my agenda of the things I'm probably interested in but I have to spend as much time on the things that people are interested in either getting my opinion either make helping them make a decision or you know just having that cross in many ways its the cross team conversations that you have to spend time on in your role because youre they don t communicate as as well No or they do it in silos No its not the silos Its more like that s your role I mean what s your role You are consolidating across the different functions. So I its its not about them Its about you right And if you re playing that role of assimilating between product and marketing or legal and finance uh I I just view that as that s my role And so I think one of the best parts about me creating content and I tell this to people is that I just get access to people like you and it just helps me become a better entrepreneur because I m just like I have this I have these questions and now I have the best in the world to kind of ask them and you know figure it out What does the Adobe India team do Like the team here that I see right there about 3000 people in this campus what is Adobe India s focus you know um when we first started the campus and this was you know probably six months before I joined the company um Nares Gupta who started the company had this vision of he wanted to just create the best hire the best and build innovative products and not do stuff that would be perceived as you know maintenance or grant work and that stayed true to I mean part of what strategy is if you cant articulate the strategy in a few words its probably too complicated so we ve always believed in Adobe India I mean apart from the sales because you know India is a big market but if your question was around what does the product team do its all about product innovation and therefore they re involved in every major product in fact we run an entire business Abigan Modi who runs the India office right now he runs the global business for acrobat and PDF F and so you know I time is not really and time and location is not how you run stuff and so uh but we do fundamental stuff from you know I think we file the number of patents that are filed from this place has always been off the charts but it started with this germ of an idea of you know hire absolutely the best and create a differentiated product group that believes that their job is building innovative products and ownership and you know when people feel ownership then you're not holding them accountable They re holding themselves accountable And I its its thrived because of that core sort of way in which the company was formed I have one last question for you I think you ve been generous with your time I have one last question My wife actually runs a video editing school and she said one of the biggest requests they had was you know a youngster who is for the first time getting into some of the Adobe tools especially in India There s been this request of there needs to be a low cost easy way for them to get in and you know they will be the biggest champions and influencers of Adobe inside the augs once they get placed because the school also has a lot of placements Do you have a plan for to do to ever do a lower cost easier way to get in sort of product for you know premier pro at least  Well there are two ways I would you know interpret the question The first is we want to make sure these products are easily the onramp to the products We want them to be as simple as possible And so I I think again the fact that we have the spectrum from mobile apps to web based apps to uh desktop apps we have actually made them way more uh you know accessible The second thing is uh educational pricing and you know finding ways to have educational pricing Not enough people know about that actually and we should market that better and we should market that better and uh but you know clearly I I think this is an area that we need to do more I think we ve done a lot of great stuff but making it affordable and accessible because you re absolutely right I mean the folks that your wife is you know training are going to be the next generation creatives and the more they are and the more they love Adobe software when they enter the professional world I mean the irony is that also happened in many ways when you know piracy was rampant in many countries but when we moved to the cloud we were incredibly surprised by how people were fundamentally wanting to do the right thing you know for the value that were getting and it got cheaper and so that s a constant refrain I think the mobile apps will be you know we have premium mobile apps so you know you can do a lot of that functionality but we will also follow up with your wife s uh video editing uh school to understand how we can serve them better Awesome Thank you so much Shantu This was amazing I learned so much I hopefully become a better you know founder after this And this is so enlightening Thank you so much Its my pleasure Thanks for having me Likewise","Photoshop right The flagship has been around for so long We wouldnt be able to exist without Photoshop We do so much creative work today What s the secret behind the longevity You build products for yourselves And you know I think if you have a creative community and a DNA within the company I think in many ways you know the most the sternest critics are yourselves How does one get into the position of being CEO of Adobe I was the last man standing What is the career path to be where you re at You know what has that journey been like for you personally If I go back really a long way around I wanted to be a journalist growing up I did not want to be CEO I just wanted to build great products I saw that you had recently said that in India creativity might be the next IT boom I want to know more about your thesis on on the creativity versus IT piece We have the saying at Adobe where everybody has a story to tell How do you not piss off like an entire legion of artists by going overly generative but also how do you continue to stay relevant Because if you don t do that somebody else will counter position and say Well were the generative only suite If you use the Firefly models we said were the company that has to respect and champion the intellectual property rights of the creative professionals When when did you know you were going to be CEO Like what was that moment like Well you know I ladies and gentlemen I am with the Adobe Global Chair and CEO Shantanu Narayan Shantu its an absolute honor to do this Its uh kind of been you know I ve been using Adobe tools since since before I knew what I was doing in life right One of the first exposures to an Adobe tool I had was maybe CS5 or CS6 And at that time you know if you wanted to make a website you d have to use the slicing tool Youd have to have an image You have to slice it up And since then you know the standards have changed Since then the ways you make a website have changed The ways you do design have changed Tools have come tools have gone I would have bet a lot because I was very bullish on you know on on the internet when I was very young I would I was very bullish on the idea that at some point there will be somebody that comes and does what Adobe does in the cloud and does that better But somehow Photoshop right the flagship has been around for so long And before I get into anything I just want to know the secret of this longevity right We wouldnt be able to exist without Photoshop We do so much creative work today What's the secret behind the longevity Well first Vun its a pleasure to be on your show and thank you for being a creative Uh its always fun to hear stories about people whose lives have changed as a result of pursuing creative endeavors something that as you can imagine we have a tremendous passion for I think as it relates to you know building products uh you know I think there are a couple of lessons I ve learned The first is you build products for yourselves And you know I think if you have a creative community and a DNA within the company I think in many ways uh you know the most the sternest critics are yourselves and so were I think always trying to say you know uh how do we build products that you know delight us and uh become more affordable accessible uh uh but you're being kind also I mean you know I think as all good companies we're probably more self-critical of the things that we haven't done right Uh we've certainly done some things right and um you know its just its a constant endeavor And do you feel like working on desktop apps because I ve heard from a lot of people right working on desktops apps especially in this era its pretty difficult because you re working with something that s legacy thats been built a long time ago You re probably rebuilding parts of it as you go Is it harder to do than lets say building something in the cloud if you're doing it from scratch Well we don t think of it as desktop apps and cloud or mobile I mean I think we think of it a lot more as surfaces and you know when uh all of these tectonic technology shifts happen you know I when the move uh to a mobile device happened you know one of the assertions we made was mobile devices shouldnt just be consumption devices they should be creation devices when we saw the cloud we looked at it and said why should you be tethered to a computer inspiration strikes at many uh times and so you should do it So I you know I I think we uh are constantly thinking about what surface provides what value and are you taking advantage of the surface Uh many times I think you unfortunately try to uh retrofit what works well in one surface and another surface and you fail and so you know I I I think we tend to think of it as the web affords friction free usage of technology mobile allows you you know a different kind of a screen factor and and ease of use and and speed at doing things Uh but the desktop I think has continued and the PC frankly has continued to be the place where most people would say they re the most productive and they re the most efficient And so take advantage of all the surfaces because at the end of the day that allows us to target and deal with more customers No that makes sense Um Chanta I want to know how does one get into the position of being CEO of Adobe Like what is it What I was the last man standing What is the career path to be where you re at And you know what has that journey been like for you personally You know I if I go back really a long way Vun I wanted to be a journalist growing up Um you know I I was always fascinated by writing and um the first ever job which as you know uh at least in the 80s when I grew up in India um you didn't really have summer jobs and you didnt have internships but um I apprenticed at you know a newspaper doing copywriting So you know journalism was always important to me Um and now vicariously I m still part of the publishing industry but um my professional journey I I ve worked for all companies that I think have a creative DNA in them I was at Apple for many years when Jurassic Park came out I worked for Silicon Graphics I started my own company So like you Im an entrepreneur Uh unlike you I was a failed entrepreneur at what I did Uh a company I think everyone goes through enough like a bunch of failures before it works uh a company called Pictra I say the best thing that happened to me because that brought me to Adobe and Pictures on the web U you know in the early 9s I felt like that social connection would be important And then I came to Adobe because I looked at it and I said Oh my god look at the franchise that Adobe had  And Adobe was actually uh in conversations to potentially acquire picture The deal didn't happen And I said you know when I think about the brand of Photoshop and the brand of Illustrator and Acrobat it was something that really resonated with me and um I was lucky enough uh to be recruited there You know my journey at Adobe changed dramatically over the years Uh but the core genesis I think was that I'm you know maybe at my core I care about design I care about creativity I care about expression and you know Adobe is the ultimate privilege to be able to work for it I did not want to be CEO when I came It wasn't you know there are some people who are early enough in their life they know I want to be this particular role I just wanted to build great products You know what was your role like entering the company I was called a VPG GM uh you know of uh one of the groups I mean you mentioned that you're spending more time doing P&Ls You know everybody tends to think that being a GM you know you've sort of arrived Uh but funnily I joined as a GM The company hit a wall uh 6 months later and we laid off uh something like 25% of the company This was in 1998 and u they then asked me to actually take over inesign Inesign was this naent project They said ""Hey you're a technologist"" They completely reorganized to be functional So I was no longer a general manager I was an engineering uh lead for the layout products Um and then 6 months later I think you know we shipped in design in design luckily one and then they asked me to run all engineering So you know the path uh and career paths and I think even for your listeners they take different routes but I think uh if you can always think about where you add value and the value that needed to be added at that point was getting in design out of the door and you know we're at our core a product company and so and being able to run all products was a privilege When when did you know you were going to be CEO Like what was that moment like Well you know I as I said I joined in 98 By 99 I was running all engineering By 2001 I was promoted to run all products And you know at some point there along the way you're like ""Oh oh my god maybe you know I will have the opportunity to run the company"" And in 2005 I got promoted to be president and chief operating officer And that felt more real at that point But then we acquired macro media and you know the integration took a little while Um but you know when the two founders uh who unfortunately have both passed you know both brilliant brilliant brilliant people John Waro and Chuck Gashki when they told me that the board had decided that I would be the next CEO I mean professionally without a doubt um it was the most you know honor that I've received in my career and something that I cherish to this day That's a crazy story You know in our own company now we do thousands of videos a month We never thought we'd get to this scale right And generative has really been the backbone Everything from avatars to just the micro advantages you get from using generative right It could be as simple as generative fill Extend the frame right It's just so many small things that have really made our life easier We do content for 10 of our own channels 40 client channels Um and you know it's almost like in India for content we've kind of become the port of first call but we never imagined such a large opportunity to be there here right and we can see now that there's no end to where the opportunity is right and I saw that you had recently said that in India creativity might be the next IT boom right I've started to believe it but it's very hard to get the average person to believe this right because they're like well it has been around for a very very long time and creativity well it still feels like India would be you know India's not there on the global stage yet but I think generative really fills that gap Uh I want to know more about your thesis on on on the creativity versus IT piece Well you know it's I think it's true across so many dimensions right I mean the first thing is you know we have this saying at Adobe where everybody has a story to tell and so if you think about the fact that everybody has a story to tell and they want to tell their story at the end of the day that's in a way your addressable market for the world right Um if you think about education and why is it in this day and age that education is still about writing rather than you know animating or having videos or uh you know being able to express yourself graphically Um when you think about any commerce business right now a commerce business is basically about an experience and the person who creates the best experience is going to be the one that wins So you know if you decompose what creativity really means uh as a part of every industry right uh as well as this fundamental social need I mean why have the social networks really exploded it's because people fundamentally have a need to interact in a way that's unique and personal to them So that's why I'm a big believer that at the end of the day creativity is uh you know one of those fundamental uh social desires that are going that are going to create massive markets Now how you decide what component of each of these other businesses is as a result of creativity versus is commerce really creativity I tend to think it is right and it plays a role uh but that so I think it's the lens by which we approach it allows us as a company to then think about oh my god if we have this big opportunity are we capitalizing on the opportunity I think in many ways when companies scale it's not that they suddenly wake up one morning and you know the market has grown it's you're changing the aperture by which you look at the opportunity I mean when you were talking about it you know whether it's the channel that you run versus a channel for a company versus a channel So I I think that's how we're trying to expand you know how we think about creativity And you know when I went to Waves and you you gave a keynote at Waves as well right Like if you the minute you landed in Mumbai to the point where you were at the event it was plastered with like billboards on Waves and audio video communication It if if I was Adobe I would be like dancing right I would be like great like everyone's woken up I was so surprised to see a the spends b the kind of you know time energy and attention that the government is now giving you know things like creativity I think they're very bullish that this could be the next you know sort of it-esque industry u do you have a sense of how many more jobs could be created here maybe not tangible numbers but just you know what how you see this volume expand is it a training thing is it a you know if you were to architect this how would you do it well I think first it it starts with education and it starts with accessibility I you know the story that's often told about how somebody left a computer you know unattended in a small village in India and how you know people just embrace it So I I think the first thing is accessible and I think with mobile devices and PCs it's just going to become more accessible which I think is great uh because when you have accessibility you know I I think you foster opportunity u I think the second thing is uh you know inspiration So if you have accessibility you want to be inspired right And I think if there are two things that inspire people in this country at least maybe there's a little bit of a you know cliche but it's sports and cricket and it's films right And both of them are you know are inherently also experiences that you do And so I don't know that I have a number I know it's big I mean we have aspirations to even in the education market you know find two crores of people And how do you it used to be reading writing and arithmetic when I grew up were the three skills that people said were the way to improve your lot Why isn't it reading writing arithmetic and digital literacy with creativity a fundamental part of that So if you think about it that way then every single student with this skill now has an opportunity if you're a small and be small business if you're a person working in the creative So I I think it's unlimited Now how much of that then translates into economic you know GDP and the growth associated with that I think that's work ahead of us But I what I was really impressed with what the government was doing was to say hey this is just one of those fundamental things that if we do right you know we're going to foster a new generation I know they've always been enamored with the animation industry and the graphics industry The publishing industry still in India is probably the most lucrative publishing industry in the world Right And so I I but I think it solves these fundamental issues of education of opportunity And so I I think it's immense Yeah Um I have a question around generative AI and this is a I often say that somebody's asking me this the other day and I and I said that it's kind of a tough spot to be in Adobe's like shoes right now mainly because there's two clear audiences here right Or or maybe that's the general subset of two audiences one who will adopt everything that everything new in generative AI they want it they want to speed up their workflows they probably have a lot of work on their plate and they want to move forward there's also a group of creatives that is a little bit anti-generative right and there is a line that they draw which is well generative fill is fine but if you're using you know um you know something which is completely AI generated that's a problem right so it is it's hard because you can't end up building two product suites right one with generative one without generative Um so how do you see this Like how do you not piss off like an entire legion of artists by going overly generative but also how do you continue to stay relevant Because if you don't do that somebody else will counterposition and say well we're the generative only suite I I actually think Adobe has done a phenomenal job of addressing that upfront And part of what we talk about as a company is it's not just the technology but it's the responsibility that we have as one of the larger companies in the space to speak on behalf of the community So I I'll geek out for a little while First as it relates to our models and the models that we've created as you know we were the company that said we're only going to create these models based on licensed content Very unique very differentiated And so if you use the Firefly models we said we're the company that has to respect and champion the rights the intellectual property rights of the creative professionals which is why we do it You know we have Behance as you know it's one of the largest if not the largest creative professional network in the world but we did not train on that because we didn't have rights to do that So first we made a very strong uh you know statement of what we thought about intellectual property Now I think that appealed to the community because the community said if there's one company that's speaking up for the rights of and I think the courts will eventually have to appine on some of this stuff but we make that stance and we actually have stuck by it Um I think there's so how do we think about it in terms of product strategy To your point we have such a wide variety of customers consumers who want to use a product like Adobe Express they probably don't need the flexibility of multiple models So they're just like I fear the blank page The real beauty or the benefit of generative AI is that most people when they have something that they want to create they fear the blank page Whereas being able to have a conversation and have that process kicked off either with a template or with a conversation enables them to you know uh be more productive So I think for that community we've built in Firefly we will have Express but the fact that it's commercially safe The consumer probably cares a little bit less about what's underlying the technology they just want to get stuff done The creative professional on the other hand as you know we started off with for generative fill or generative extend we only had Firefly support because we were convinced that that was the right way to serve the creative community With enterprises you know the largest enterprises in the world are partnering with us because they don't want their content ingested by people who don't respect intellectual property So we've created custom models for them So now we also have this flexibility where if you're within Coke you're creating a marketing campaign you have a custom model of Firefly that has all your assets as well as Adobe's Firefly because that's also you know designed to be commercially safe It's the Firefly model fine-tuned on their internal app Exactly Um and you do that as a service or is that Yeah we do that as a service you know uh and the interest in that as you can imagine is immense because you know your intellectual property is your data They don't want their data you know scraped on the internet and so that's why they do that However you also if you think about where creatives are using it right now creatives have also embraced this idea of when I'm ideulating maybe I'm okay using you know a model that's not designed to be commercially safe But then later when I use it in production I want to make sure that I use it because that's like going to an art gallery and getting inspired by a painting on the wall you know to to do some creative And so at the recent Max conference we showed how you know we will support thirdparty models and that's actually come as a result of uh you know customers saying we love Adobe products support the third party model and we will differentiate between when we're using it for ideiation versus when we're using it to be uh used in production As you know also and again I'm geeking out but in the Photoshop when you upload a picture and you say hallucinate with not just the text but in the spirit of this picture we actually ask you to testify that you have rights to that picture So you know it's this balance that we're trying to do We want to give flexibility We want to serve the customers in the diverse ways in which they want to but we also want to make it clear what our northstar is of what we stand for which is you know how we stand for the intellectual property how we stand for content authenticity We're thrilled We have 4000 people who've signed up to you know uh be part of this content authenticity initiative where you uh will specify the provenence but it's work in progress And I think you know we're also a company that's smart enough to say this thing will evolve and if we don't evolve with the times we won't be serving our customers and our prospective customers Well I have a a CEO question to you right Um so when I started a company when I started this company actually we started with creativity then we said you know we'll infuse technology in here to get scale which I think has worked out well but now I find I spend most of my time like I said you know pre this chat I spend most of my time on P&L managing people figuring out how to hire people I want to know from a time management perspective right how do you actually manage your time like what do you spend most of your time on what is top priority for you what are the messages on your on your phone that you need to like like how would you say your your time management and day management framework is How much how much time do you spend on hiring Like I want to know everything like and you can go you can geek out as much as you want Well the reality is you know what you focus on changes You know I I I'll share with you what one of the co-founders John Waro told me when I took my job when I first took my job he said ""If I don't like my job I have one person to blame"" And in many ways that was the most profound piece of advice that he gave me And so bro what I'll tell you is you have more power to spend the time on whatever you want to spend the time on And you know one of the things we try and do as a senior executive team every year at the beginning of the year is we say what are the two or three things that you want to do that you think will really move the needle or have impact in the company and then disproportionately spend time on that uh your demands whether they be IR investors or you know PR or whether it's product or whether it's customers it could be infinite and you know time is your most valuable commodity So I'm actually quite thoughtful about where I am going to spend my time and where I'm not going to spend my time And the power of a team is that you can get somebody else to do the stuff that you're either not very good at or you don't have an inclination to do So but it changes One year I might say I want to spend time on industry partnerships and I'm going to invest my time and energy on that But I have that conversation with my team so that somebody else is picking up the stuff that perhaps I'm not going to be spending time on and then you trust your team to you know do the other stuff So I that that's the advice that I would give but it changes The one constant I would say in my job is product At the end of the day we're a product company If you don't build innovative great products and in many ways my role is chief product officer as well right when you're running a tech company you should be that And so that's the constant But otherwise I flip it around I flip it around because I want to have fun doing the things that I want to do and and I you know dirty secret for both of us We have the luxury of doing that Can I ask you a question on how you communicate with your team Do you are you very verbal about it Do you do you do meetings or are you like I'm going to write a note and do you spend a lot of time writing those notes Like what's your feed like how do you how do you communicate with them You know my philosophy on the team we have pretty regular check-ins every Monday So a Monday is sort of And how big is that exactly Six seven people I mean that's the thing when people also say ""Oh my god you run this large company"" The liberating fact is you still have the same number of people whether the company is you know 5 million or the company is 5000 or the company is 50 And you know it's the power of that team that helps you manage and scale and grow the company I like email because I think it forces me to be more precise and I also find that you know when when you have a conversation with people people interpret different things and so I I I've always liked the discipline of writing it but only for important things right I mean if you have a product strategy issue or if you have something that you think the company is not doing well then I think taking the trouble to actually write it pays off in spades but otherwise you know we have meetings it's a very open flow we call it roundt and the roundt idea is whatever's top of mind I mean in many ways I also m view my role as removing obstacles and so I have my agenda of the things I'm probably interested in but I have to spend as much time on the things that people are interested in either getting my opinion either make helping them make a decision or you know just having that cross in many ways its the cross team conversations that you have to spend time on in your role because youre they don t communicate as as well No or they do it in silos No its not the silos Its more like that s your role I mean what s your role You are consolidating across the different functions So I its its not about them Its about you right And if you re playing that role of assimilating between product and marketing or legal and finance uh I I just view that as that s my role And so I think one of the best parts about me creating content and I tell this to people is that I just get access to people like you and it just helps me become a better entrepreneur because I m just like I have this I have these questions and now I have the best in the world to kind of ask them and you know figure it out What does the Adobe India team do Like the team here that I see right there about 3000 people in this campus what is Adobe India s focus you know um when we first started the campus and this was you know probably six months before I joined the company um Nares Gupta who started the company had this vision of he wanted to just create the best hire the best and build innovative products and not do stuff that would be perceived as you know maintenance or grant work and that stayed true to I mean part of what strategy is if you cant articulate the strategy in a few words its probably too complicated so we ve always believed in Adobe India I mean apart from the sales because you know India is a big market but if your question was around what does the product team do its all about product innovation and therefore they re involved in every major product in fact we run an entire business Abigan Modi who runs the India office right now he runs the global business for acrobat and PDF F and so you know I time is not really and time and location is not how you run stuff and so uh but we do fundamental stuff from you know I think we file the number of patents that are filed from this place has always been off the charts but it started with this germ of an idea of you know hire absolutely the best and create a differentiated product group that believes that their job is building innovative products and ownership and you know when people feel ownership then you're not holding them accountable They re holding themselves accountable And I its its thrived because of that core sort of way in which the company was formed I have one last question for you I think you ve been generous with your time I have one last question My wife actually runs a video editing school and she said one of the biggest requests they had was you know a youngster who is for the first time getting into some of the Adobe tools especially in India There s been this request of there needs to be a low cost easy way for them to get in and you know they will be the biggest champions and influencers of Adobe inside the augs once they get placed because the school also has a lot of placements Do you have a plan for to do to ever do a lower cost easier way to get in sort of product for you know premier pro at least  Well there are two ways I would you know interpret the question The first is we want to make sure these products are easily the onramp to the products We want them to be as simple as possible And so I I think again the fact that we have the spectrum from mobile apps to web based apps to uh desktop apps we have actually made them way more uh you know accessible The second thing is uh educational pricing and you know finding ways to have educational pricing Not enough people know about that actually and we should market that better and we should market that better and uh but you know clearly I I think this is an area that we need to do more I think we ve done a lot of great stuff but making it affordable and accessible because you re absolutely right I mean the folks that your wife is you know training are going to be the next generation creatives and the more they are and the more they love Adobe software when they enter the professional world I mean the irony is that also happened in many ways when you know piracy was rampant in many countries but when we moved to the cloud we were incredibly surprised by how people were fundamentally wanting to do the right thing you know for the value that were getting and it got cheaper and so that s a constant refrain I think the mobile apps will be you know we have premium mobile apps so you know you can do a lot of that functionality but we will also follow up with your wife s uh video editing uh school to understand how we can serve them better Awesome Thank you so much Shantu This was amazing I learned so much I hopefully become a better you know founder after this And this is so enlightening Thank you so much Its my pleasure Thanks for having me

8g-r49fM_wY,Google's Android XR glasses are pretty cool!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g-r49fM_wY,"Google just unveiled their Android XR glasses at IO 2025, and they look like regular glasses, but pack some seriously cool tech. First up, see how they handle navigation. So, I'm wearing the new glasses, which has a screen. You can't see it, but I'm actually navigating Google Maps as we speak. This is what I see. By the way, I see this. So, I can actually navigate. I just have to look down. And when I'm looking down, you can see that I'm actually navigating. I'm just going to turn. Next up is their realtime translation. This is something which blew my [Music] mind. As you can see, the translation happens instantly. The glasses can understand multiple languages and show you what's being said right in your field of view. This could completely change how we communicate across language barriers. Now, what makes these special is that they combine cameras, microphones, speakers, and a hidden display that only you can see. Google built these with Samsung and Qualcomm, creating a new Android XR platform that's designed to work perfectly with your phone. Plus, with Gemini AI built-in, the glasses can see what you're looking at and provide helpful information right when you need it. They understand your location and which way you're facing, so directions appear exactly when and where you need them. The best part, Google's partnering with Wobbby Parker and Gentle Monster, so these will actually look stylish.

q35kYNwA6tE,Quick Recap of Google IO 2025,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q35kYNwA6tE,"Ladies and gentlemen, we're at Google IO. Let's do a quick wrap. And I'm about to break down everything mind-blowing from the 2025 keynote in just a quick minute. Now, Google is going allin on AI that is more intelligent, agentic, and personalized than ever before. First, they're improving their most intelligent models. Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro are getting major upgrades. The standout is Deep Think, a new enhanced reasoning mode in Gemini 2.5 Pro that can tackle super complex math and coding tasks through parallel thinking. Next up, Gemini powered agents are next level this year. Project Mariner can now juggle up to 10 tasks at once, learns workflows after you teach it just once, and powers the new agent mode inside the Gemini app. Think finding apartments, booking tours, or handling forms automatically. Plus, what's really cool is you'll soon be able to shop with AI, including virtually trying on clothes from your own photos with just a single upload. They're also launching impressive generative media models. Imagine 4 creates stunning images with better text rendering. While V3 is the first video model with native audio generation, adding environmental sounds and even dialogue to videos. Now, Google is also introducing Flow, a new AI filmmaking tool designed specifically for their advanced models that helps storytellers create cinematic clips and scenes without complicated production. For developers, Jules is now available in public beta. It's an asynchronous coding agent that integrates directly with repositories and handles tasks on your behalf. Then we have Android XR which is bringing Gemini to glasses and headsets. These smart glasses come with cameras, microphones, and an optional inland lens display working with your phone to give you hands-free AI assistance. Google is partnering with Wobbby Parker and Gentle Monster to make stylish versions. Finally, let's not forget Beam, previously called Project Starline. This AI first 3D video communication platform creates remarkably lielike conversations with speech translation capabilities. You see, I was at Google IO again this time and got my hands on some of these tools and demos. Trust me, this isn't just incremental progress.",Ladies and gentlemen we're at Google IO Let's do a quick wrap And I'm about to break down everything mind-blowing from the 2025 keynote in just a quick minute Now Google is going allin on AI that is more intelligent agentic and personalized than ever before First they're improving their most intelligent models Gemini 25 Flash and Pro are getting major upgrades The standout is Deep Think a new enhanced reasoning mode in Gemini 25 Pro that can tackle super complex math and coding tasks through parallel thinking Next up Gemini powered agents are next level this year Project Mariner can now juggle up to 10 tasks at once learns workflows after you teach it just once and powers the new agent mode inside the Gemini app Think finding apartments booking tours or handling forms automatically Plus what's really cool is you'll soon be able to shop with AI including virtually trying on clothes from your own photos with just a single upload They're also launching impressive generative media models Imagine 4 creates stunning images with better text rendering While V3 is the first video model with native audio generation adding environmental sounds and even dialogue to videos Now Google is also introducing Flow a new AI filmmaking tool designed specifically for their advanced models that helps storytellers create cinematic clips and scenes without complicated production For developers Jules is now available in public beta It's an asynchronous coding agent that integrates directly with repositories and handles tasks on your behalf Then we have Android XR which is bringing Gemini to glasses and headsets These smart glasses come with cameras microphones and an optional inland lens display working with your phone to give you hands-free AI assistance Google is partnering with Wobbby Parker and Gentle Monster to make stylish versions Finally let's not forget Beam previously called Project Starline This AI first 3D video communication platform creates remarkably lielike conversations with speech translation capabilities You see I was at Google IO again this time and got my hands on some of these tools and demos Trust me this isn't just incremental progress,Entrepreneurship
3LSpWCmyHzs,Google Veo 3 Can Now Generate Native Audio and Cinematic Videos,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LSpWCmyHzs,"Google just announced V3 at IO and for the first time ever, a video generation model can create not just visuals, but native audio, too. [Music] They left behind a a ball today. It bounced higher than I can jump. What manner of magic is that? According to Google's announcement, across the board, V3 excels from text and image prompting to real world physics and accurate lip-s syncing. It understands your ideas well. You can tell a short story in your prompt and the model gives you back a clip that brings it to life. This understanding is what makes VO3 such a gamechanger for filmmakers. But speaking of filmmakers, Google also designed Flow as an AI filmmaking tool explicitly built for VO. Flow takes Vio's capabilities further, helping storytellers explore their ideas without bounds, and create cinematic clips and scenes for their stories. With Flow, you describe shots in natural language. Manage story elements in one place and weave everything into beautiful scenes. Flow also unlocks powerful features like camera controls that help you define precise camera movements, including rotations, dollies, and zooms.

tzqnycMoldI,Why Freshers Are Struggling to Get Tech Jobs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzqnycMoldI,"Have you noticed it's gotten way harder to land a tech job as a fresher? According to data from DD, the biggest tech companies, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Nvidia, and Palanteer have had zero net growth in hiring over the last 3 years. That's right, zero growth. The total headcount today is basically the same as it was 3 years ago. So, what exactly is happening during the pandemic? These companies went on a massive hiring spree. Just look at this graph. That huge spike in 2022, that's when they collectively added over 120,000 employees in a single year. But then in 2023, we actually saw negative growth with companies cutting jobs. But the big question is, how are these tech giants growing their businesses without growing their teams? It boils down to these four fundamental changes. First, they overhired during the zero interest rate pandemic years between 2020 and 2022, assuming the demand boom would continue long-term. It did not. Second, with higher interest rates now, CFOs are under intense pressure to improve operating margins, and keeping headcount flat is the most direct way to boost those numbers. Third, these companies are investing billions in generative AI infrastructure. The cost of capital for these chips and systems is enormous, leaving less budget for new hires. Fourth, there's emerging evidence that AI productivity tools might already be enabling these companies to accomplish more with their existing workforce. This last point is actually huge because it's changing a fundamental relationship in business. The data historically showed that if a company's revenue grew by 10%, its headcount would also grow by about 10%. But these AI productivity gains are breaking that pattern. Now these tech leaders are testing whether they can grow revenue without growing headcount at all. This represents the potential end of the hyperrowth hiring era that defined tech from 2010 to 2021.",Have you noticed it's gotten way harder to land a tech job as a fresher According to data from DD the biggest tech companies Google Microsoft Apple Tesla Meta Nvidia and Palanteer have had zero net growth in hiring over the last 3 years That's right zero growth The total headcount today is basically the same as it was 3 years ago So what exactly is happening during the pandemic These companies went on a massive hiring spree Just look at this graph That huge spike in 2022 that's when they collectively added over 120000 employees in a single year But then in 2023 we actually saw negative growth with companies cutting jobs But the big question is how are these tech giants growing their businesses without growing their teams It boils down to these four fundamental changes First they overhired during the zero interest rate pandemic years between 2020 and 2022 assuming the demand boom would continue long-term It did not Second with higher interest rates now CFOs are under intense pressure to improve operating margins and keeping headcount flat is the most direct way to boost those numbers Third these companies are investing billions in generative AI infrastructure The cost of capital for these chips and systems is enormous leaving less budget for new hires Fourth there's emerging evidence that AI productivity tools might already be enabling these companies to accomplish more with their existing workforce This last point is actually huge because it's changing a fundamental relationship in business The data historically showed that if a company's revenue grew by 10% its headcount would also grow by about 10% But these AI productivity gains are breaking that pattern Now these tech leaders are testing whether they can grow revenue without growing headcount at all This represents the potential end of the hyperrowth hiring era that defined tech from 2010 to 2021,

Now, I want tentacles all over my face. Now, we're going to have somebody from the comment section punch me. Now I'm going to disintegrate. All of these effects were created with AI using a tool called Higs Field. Here's how it works. Now, all you have to do is upload a first frame from your video and go to the effects panel. That's it. Choose your desired effect, such as Venom taking over your body, getting punched, or turning into metal. The software uses AI to analyze your image and apply realistic transformations that follow your movements throughout the clip. What's mind-blowing is that until recently, these effects would have taken professional VFX artists hours or even days to create. They'd have to manually track every movement and adjust the effect frame by frame. But now, this tech does it automatically in minutes. The coolest part is that this tech is accessible to everyone. No fancy equipment or Hollywood budget is needed. People are using it for everything from social media videos to indie films.

6LxjHqQnjkw,Fortnite's darth vader just got jailbroken and it's hilarious!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LxjHqQnjkw,"Fortnite's Darth Vader just got jailbroken and people are making it say anything they want. I find your enthusiasm unsettling Peter Griffin and gooning gang. Explain this adolescent term. Now, we can't tell you what it means for obvious reasons, but it shows Peter Griffin holding a lightsaber and facing off with Darth Vader. But instead of Vader saying something serious like he usually does, he says something totally unexpected. So, how did this happen? Well, it's because Epic Games added characters like Darth Vader using AI so players could interact with them. According to Fortnite's website, when players talk to Darth Vader, their voice gets converted into text and fed into Google's Gemini, which writes a reply matching Darth Vader's personality. Then 11 Labs, a texttovoice model, takes that reply and speaks it out loud in Vader's voice. Now, that's what should have happened ideally, but players quickly realized that by asking Vader to repeat after me or using clever replies, they could bypass Fortnite's filters and trick Gemini into saying almost anything they want. In other words, they weren't exactly hacking the system, but manipulating Gemini by finding loopholes in how LLM understand language. While this might be funny to some, remember that Fortnite is played by millions of kids as well, and pre-exposing them to such stuff probably isn't good for them. Epic Games says they've now fixed the issue with a hot fix and added more safety checks. Like, if a player is under 13, they cannot talk to these AI characters without parental consent. But it'll be interesting to see what happens",Fortnite's Darth Vader just got jailbroken and people are making it say anything they want I find your enthusiasm unsettling Peter Griffin and gooning gang Explain this adolescent term Now we can't tell you what it means for obvious reasons but it shows Peter Griffin holding a lightsaber and facing off with Darth Vader But instead of Vader saying something serious like he usually does he says something totally unexpected So how did this happen Well it's because Epic Games added characters like Darth Vader using AI so players could interact with them According to Fortnite's website when players talk to Darth Vader their voice gets converted into text and fed into Google's Gemini which writes a reply matching Darth Vader's personality Then 11 Labs a texttovoice model takes that reply and speaks it out loud in Vader's voice Now that's what should have happened ideally but players quickly realized that by asking Vader to repeat after me or using clever replies they could bypass Fortnite's filters and trick Gemini into saying almost anything they want In other words they weren't exactly hacking the system but manipulating Gemini by finding loopholes in how LLM understand language While this might be funny to some remember that Fortnite is played by millions of kids as well and pre-exposing them to such stuff probably isn't good for them Epic Games says they've now fixed the issue with a hot fix and added more safety checks Like if a player is under 13 they cannot talk to these AI characters without parental consent But it'll be interesting to see what happens,

This might be one of the biggest AI acquisitions ever. So, what exactly is Windsurf? Back in December 2022, it was called Kodium, a free AI coding assistant. The CEO posted it on Hacker News saying they wanted to open up access of generative AI to all developers for free. But check out what one user commented. What's the difference with Copilot? In my exact 3minut test, it did worse, even if only slightly. Right now, it is free, but that won't last, right? Do I have to expect any shady data collection practices? More interestingly, how is this trained? Have you guys done your own fine-tuning of GPT3 or is it something completely different? Fast forward to today and that same tool someone brushed off is now potentially worth $3 billion. This completely challenges the common advice that you shouldn't just build rappers around AI APIs. And companies like Windsurf prove there's massive value in making AI more accessible to developers. Now, you know, the AI world moves at lightning speed. A product casually dismissed after a three-minute test is now just 3 years later at the center of what could be one of the biggest AI acquisitions ever.

2utmSZnKOpc,AI is 6X Better at Persuading Humans Than People!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2utmSZnKOpc,"A recent study on Reddit revealed that AI is six times better at persuading humans than other humans. Now, researchers at the University of Zurich secretly slipped AI bots into social media conversations, and no one even realized they weren't talking to real people. Here's how it went down. The researchers set up 13 AI powered accounts on Reddit's Change My View subreddit, a community specifically designed for people to share their opinions and invite others to challenge or change their perspective. But here's the shocking part, how these bots actually worked. They analyzed the person's entire Reddit posting history to figure out their age, gender, location, political beliefs, and even their likes and dislikes based on their profile. Sometimes the AI even crafted elaborate fake personas. One AI accused members of a religious group of causing the deaths of hundreds of innocent traders, farmers, and villagers. Another posed as a trauma counselor specializing in abuse. One AI even claimed to be a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter. The Reddit moderators discovered this experiment after the fact and were furious. They filed an ethics complaint with the university, arguing that people come to their forum to engage with other humans, not to be unwitting subjects in an AI experiment. This connects to what some refer to as the dead internet theory. The notion that increasingly our online interactions may be with AI bots rather than real humans. As these bots become more sophisticated and widespread, how will we know who or what we're really talking to? I find this both fascinating and deeply unsettling. Technology is amazing, but we need transparency about who's behind the screen.

Its color, lights, interior, bumpers, screens, and even converted into an SUV. What's even more impressive is that it's cheaper than a Tesla at just $20,000. And that's no coincidence. If you look closely at the name, you'll notice that the name Slate is actually an anagram of Tesla, meaning it has the exact same letters, just rearranged. And that's exactly what Slate is doing. It's taking what Tesla built, futuristic, cool, and expensive cars, and rearranging it into something more minimal, simpler, and affordable. Now, a lot of people on X have even been suggesting that it might actually be a subbrand of Tesla to attract a more affordable customer base. But in reality, it's backed by Jeff Bezos, one of Elon's biggest rivals in the space race already. And that alone makes Slate even more intriguing. Is Slate trying to beat Tesla just like Blue Origin is trying to beat SpaceX? Maybe, maybe not. But what's clear is while the world is going crazy over futuristic looking EVs, Slate is taking a minimalistic approach by doing the opposite.

P98hXwLKeUI,This Robot Factory Makes a Phone Every Second,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P98hXwLKeUI,"Did you know that Xiaomi has this full-blown autonomous factory that runs 24/7 with zero workers and produces a new phone every single second? Spanning over 81,000 m, this dark factory operates completely autonomously with no lights, no shifts, and no humans. But how? Well, all thanks to Xiaomi's AI powered manufacturing system called Hyper Intelligent Manufacturing Platform or Hyper IMP. You see, most factories run on static automation. That means each machine is programmed only once and it performs only one specific task over and over again and that works fine until something goes wrong, a misalignment or a sensor glitch and suddenly the machines don't know how to handle it and need humans to fix it. But Xiaomi's factory is different. The machines aren't just following instructions. They're also training a central AI system called HyperMP by sending real-time data. The AI system then uses this data to constantly analyze every machine in the factory. And if something seems off, it goes ahead and fixes it without any human involvement. But this isn't about Xiaomi cranking out a new phone every second. It's about a much bigger shift happening in China. China has cracked the code on something far more powerful, automation at scale. People think of China as a country of cheap labor. But what they don't realize is that it's not because Chinese factories are filled with lowcost workers. It's because those factories have now become completely automated and are being run almost entirely by robots. And this is the kind of automation that changes how a country innovates. China isn't using robots just to make things quicker, but to free up human time so people can stop doing repetitive work and focus on R&D, innovation, and improving technology.",Did you know that Xiaomi has this full-blown autonomous factory that runs 24/7 with zero workers and produces a new phone every single second Spanning over 81000 m this dark factory operates completely autonomously with no lights no shifts and no humans But how Well all thanks to Xiaomi's AI powered manufacturing system called Hyper Intelligent Manufacturing Platform or Hyper IMP You see most factories run on static automation That means each machine is programmed only once and it performs only one specific task over and over again and that works fine until something goes wrong a misalignment or a sensor glitch and suddenly the machines don't know how to handle it and need humans to fix it But Xiaomi's factory is different The machines aren't just following instructions They're also training a central AI system called HyperMP by sending real-time data The AI system then uses this data to constantly analyze every machine in the factory And if something seems off it goes ahead and fixes it without any human involvement But this isn't about Xiaomi cranking out a new phone every second It's about a much bigger shift happening in China China has cracked the code on something far more powerful automation at scale People think of China as a country of cheap labor But what they don't realize is that it's not because Chinese factories are filled with lowcost workers It's because those factories have now become completely automated and are being run almost entirely by robots And this is the kind of automation that changes how a country innovates China isn't using robots just to make things quicker but to free up human time so people can stop doing repetitive work and focus on R&D innovation and improving technology,
Gw20CwE5x-w,This AI changes your accent in REAL-TIME!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw20CwE5x-w,"If you've ever been a call center agent with an Indian English accent, this new AI tool called crisp accent conversion lets you transform your speech into standard American English in real time while you're talking. My name is Manoj and I'm a call center agent from India. Clear communication is vital for my customers and me, but accent barriers can sometimes make it challenging. Let me show you the voice preservation mode in action. This mode keeps my original voice intact while softening challenging parts of my accent. It helps customers understand me better, improving satisfaction on both sides of the call. This mood allows me to stay authentic, making every interaction more personal and effective. Now, the AI operates through a virtual audio driver with just 200 milliseconds of latency. That's faster than the human perception of conversation. Plus, Crisp trained their AI on thousands of paired recordings of Indian English and American English speech patterns to make this possible. However, it preserves your unique voice characteristics while modifying the pronunciation and intonation patterns. It's essentially changing how you sound without altering your voice. Now, this tech is just weird, isn't it? It's like we're creating digital masks for our voices. Think about it. Your accent is part of your identity, your story, your culture, and now an AI can just strip that away in milliseconds. But what do you think about this? Is there something strange about an AI that can erase part of who you are from your voice? Or is it just a practical tool for better communication?

If you're a Game of Thrones fan, this sounds like fantasy becoming reality, and it is. Colossal Biosciences, a company dedicated to genetic engineering and de-extinction projects, has successfully brought back dire wolves after being extinct for over 10,000 years. [Music] Now, these ancient predators were reconstructed using DNA from fossils dating back 11,500 and 72,000 years. Technically, Colossal used crisper gene editing to recreate the genome, bridging the gap between ancient samples and modern wolves. The project has already resulted in three dire wolves with distinctive thick white fur that showcases characteristics scientists couldn't determine from fossils alone. Colossal's mission goes beyond reviving extinct species. It's about taking responsibility for Earth's biodiversity. As the company's CEO, Ben Lamb, explained on Joe Rogan's podcast, they're not just focused on dire wolves. They're also working on woolly mammoths, Tasmanian tigers, and the dodo. They even created woolly mice as a proof of concept, which went viral online because they were unexpectedly adorable. But this raises fascinating questions about deextinction. Which species should we bring back? Could this technology help wildlife conservation?

Do you have a view on how the internet should think about this evolving nature of art?",Ladies and gentlemen I'm with Sam Alman You've been tweeting a lot about India You've also been tweeting a lot about the new image gen It blows my mind What's the response been like I I don't know if I can share an exact number but like way more images than I thought the internet had What is happening with this technology in India I've never seen adoption like this of anything anywhere And it's very cool Do you have a path for how jobs will evolve now that these sort of tools are here There will be some jobs that totally go away where the AI just does them end to end and then there will be totally new classes of jobs that we just haven't seen before at all Or do you have a timeline for when you know a lot of writing code becomes English or is that not going to happen I'm less interested in that question than when a coder becomes 10 times more productive and I think that could happen this year You know there's this video of Miyazaki So of course it's an out of context video where he's looking at a model from you know many years ago something some creature thrashing around and he said that well you know I don't like this Do you have a view on how the internet should think about this evolving nature of art,

uaTfTikNe9w,I Spent 5 Days With The 0.0001% In A Secret City...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaTfTikNe9w,"okay so most of my life I've hung out on the internet I was doing some math right I got an internet connection or dialup connection maybe when I was seven or 8 years old I've sat on MSN forums I've sat on Discord I've sat on X I've been on Reddit and it's just been a very long time but in the last one or two years something's changed because of the scale of that Avatar that we have which is this thing which we didn't expect to get so big but because of the scale of that and because our business has been getting bigger too I've been getting access to the top 0. 1% of the world which is phenomenal because now I can kind of see reality for what it is everyone is making it up as they go along even people who run the economy basically actually you can't predict the future but if you just say bro I don't know there are too many variables I can't make decisions and if I do this what will people say if it fails you can't really take decisions like that so a lot of these people they disagree with others sometimes but they still keep going on with their beliefs and they try to change the world by their actions not by waiting for other people to change the world everyone is sort of playing their role the most appropriate way to say this is that the world is a stage and everyone's kind of an actor everyone plays their role or fits into an unplayed role more than money which actually doesn't matter so much on the stage it is influence that matters influence over certain sectors of society over certain Fields over certain people the truth is every actor on the stage has an audience and combined the audiences everyone in the world all actors have their fans and haters once these actors s have influence they will make money and the thing I didn't realize is that most of the actors on stage know each other it's actually a small world on stage so the world economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland is like being backstage it's like peering behind the stage curtain and seeing what's really going on it's like walking on the street and being able to randomly walk into billionaires and celebrities and I was there and like a little spy with my meta aand glasses to show you what backstage really looks like cuz see as a content creator I'm really weird I can walk among the people backstage but I'm also more comfortable and I feel so much more at home with all of you all so like Deadpool this video is me breaking the fourth wall and showing you what actually happens and my learnings at the world economic Forum I'm breaking this video into five major learnings so here [Music] goes so I was invited by the YouTube team and I landed in Zurich and I was taken by a car to Davos now Davos has really tied security because of protesters when protesters realize that the world's most influential people are gathered together they try to protest and get their causes out there I think this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it sometimes the world's most influential are blind to certain topics and protests are a good way to get in front of them but they can also be severely disruptive if the things being protested are trivial anyway I had to wait one extra hour in the capab thanks to some protests going on also I forgot to mention it was really cold there was minus something and it was snowing I know this is not a related topic but I really like that weather but of course parts of my hands and face kept freezing so I was staying at the Google Alpine in like I told you YouTube had invited me and every major company and nation in the world has their own house that's right daos is full of houses Salesforce has their own house so does Intel and Qualcomm and India and even Africa during the day you can enter any house the houses also many of times have lodging so the house delegates don't have to find some other place to stay all the houses are designed very differently representing their brand colors and Vibe my favorite house was actually by palent there was these really cool LED strips which I'm definitely going to rip off that style I'm going to put some of those in our office then we went to get our badges I got a media badge which has decent levels of access across Davos you need to swipe your badge to get in in any place there are checkpoints all over now I spoke on a bunch of panels about AI plus content which we're pretty good at at this point at some of the houses that invited me but I didn't record any of it because the audience of the panels would see the white lights on the metari band so I really record uh we do over 400 million views a month across all our channels now many of them you don't even know about and over time we'll start learning which are the channels that we run and you'll come across them right but mainly my biggest learning at Davos especially with this is that this is some kind of big Fest where every faction or team has a house countries and big companies are kind of seen the same way and each house has Representatives it's like Harry Potter houses kind of right the second second learning is that a lot of big deals actually got done in Davos a Big Brand Clos and advertising deal with me there and the numbers are generally bigger I think everyone goes to daos in this Vibe of oh I'm here to close big deals or something like that right because you know other people are doing it you kind of get into a mood of also doing it I don't know it was kind of strange like India the country yes closed a lot of deals but they could have also closed those deals in India but believe it or not it's actually kind of convenient in Davos because the media is right outside the door you can walk to influential media people and say hey hey me and this person are closing this deal please go report on it and they report on it in India if you're sitting here you have to go through traditional channels people are busy you have to really think about the news cycle but there the media representatives are right outside I mean like I told you it's backstage people already know they're going to close a deal it's not like the deal happened there it's not like the decision- making happened there the closing the signing happened there no decisions are really made in Davos that is pred decided but the final sign is sometimes done there and reported there okay my third learning is that the parties suck at least the ones I went to when there's so much media nobody does anything I saw Mark Benny off the founder of Salesforce and he was just sitting in a place called Go's house with a bunch of people because see they also can't do stupid stuff because if you do stupid stuff the media will report on it nobody really does anything or maybe I just didn't find any insane stuff going on because I wasn't invited to any of those parties but I found it very boring just sitting and eating I mean especially the parts after the sessions right the nights and because you don't know the others it's basically like you're talking about basic stuff like what's the weather in your home place or something boring like that before we move on to the next part I want to share something that could help if you're hunting for a job as a fresher the demand for video editors is real and finding a good one is hard we have been fortunate in this case as we hire directly from A's video editing cohort almost all of the editors on my content team are from their cohort so if you are looking to break into video editing and work with creators like me check out their free editing master class and get a glimpse of their month intensive editing cohort that can help you land a job their recruitment network is 750 plus company strong so your odds of getting hired are high if you work hard the link is in the description now back to the video my next learning from Davos was about messaging four to 5 years ago and most of you don't know this I had this channel called Varun Maya level 2 i' made lots of very educational content on it we deep died into things like Unreal Engine right we did tutorials on it we did oops in Unreal Engine for example but notice how in the Unreal Engine series the first video has several thousand views but towards the end it has like 8090 views that's because everyone says they like super technical stuff but they don't the masses really get bored of it in the last year or so I stopped going too deep if you've noticed my content especially from a teaching front I've invested in companies that do it instead but me personally no the reason for this and what I learned at Davos again is that when you're on a stage and you have a large audience not everyone can understand everything when you're young you want validation from your PE so you get very technical about things but in places like Davos people speak more about broad goals like that event place I told you about the gos house in Go's house there are these banners that talk about un goals they are banners talking about broad goals right like no poverty zero hunger clean water sustainable cities these are very broad they aren't technical deep Dives right like in the zero hunger goal nobody's talking about hey use this very specific fertilizer to make crop growth better no they're talking about broad goals this is because people take back and remember only broad goals not the names of fertilizers the minute you get into specific fertilizers you get the equivalent of 80 to 90 views on my Unreal Engine content right low mental retention it's the same with my short form content I have so little time so we are being a little bit generic there it's what the mes want and if you don't get it that's actually you not understanding the world well and gos house is a good representation of it right go for the broader stuff don't get too deep dive unless you're making like a really long form video sometimes I get called out and cancel it for it saying oh you're not being technical anymore or whatever but that's okay it's the gos house phenomena it's important for you to learn also when you are communicating it's important to communicate the broad goals you want to achieve rather than specific advances unless someone is asking for specific advancements like if I was investing in your company I'd ask for specific things right how does this exactly work show me but otherwise for most busy people you're a turn off especially for the first conversation you get 80 to 90 [Music] views my last learning about Davos is about people I learned that the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the smartest they're not even the most hardworking they're actually just very good at taking risk and building relationships it's more courage than skill Jeff Bezos has that thing right there isn't a shortage of supply of Genius but there's definitely a shortage of supply of Courage so first before we get into courage let's talk about their distribution all the people in Davos have offline distribution in their phones they know maybe 50,000 people who can help them with anything they want they know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy most of you have 10 to 20 people in your life who can help you with things your friends in the last year what I saw happen to to me was my own Rolodex the contact called a Rolodex has gotten very large this is Now offline distribution I have some online distribution but also I've built up offline distribution some of the people at Davos can just call Prime Ministers and presidents of countries they very very well networked and have built strong relationships most of you what I've noticed at least on the internet fail at relationships young people are more likely to dunk on someone they don't know on social media for the attention of other young people in faceless accounts but the minute you say go out and meet people they don't do that because that requires work that requires energy that requires you having to maintain a conversation with your real face and your real voice in Davos I saw a lot of meetings happen that were just relationship building No Agenda just I want to get to know this person and maybe there's an opportunity 5 years later They're all playing the long game I'll give you an example one of my subsidiary companies AOS Labs so AOS is the company I run but there's a subsidiary we have called Labs that's done an AI project with Honeywell we've actually done something with the Bangalore City police with Honeywell so we're interfacing with Honeywell SAS platform with a voice too AI solution to to help automate some of these calls that the police gets anyway so what I did is I went there and met the CEO of Honeywell IIA where we spoke for a bit about the project just building a relationship right now the project's already in the PO stage so it's like Canal's involvement is going to end now but over the next let's say 2 years or 3 years I'm sure we'll do something else with them so that relationship matters the other part is about risks you can take risks when you have a lot of information and a lot of Davos is about information I know what new AI models and AI tools around the corner I know which ones are doing well and which ones are about to close large funding rounds I know which ones are doing badly because I hear it in the offline world right the companies investors I'll speak to it's it's just access to know what is working and what's not really working so I know the companies where they've closed the last funding ground but will be announced 6 months later it's so valuable to have this information before anybody else because we build on top of models right so it's so important to know what's working what can we catch 6 months later 8 months later as the underlying model gets better what we did with Avatar in some senses right so I keep sharing all of this on my YouTube so definitely do subscribe this is the same as when I entered Google deep Min getting access to information which is not out on the internet lowers your risk profile when trying new things so the parent company AOS literally our only job is to build distribution and keep trying experiments right and then we pass it on to a subsidiary as it gets big enough so all of this is very useful for us because it lowers my risk profile of trying new things well that's it I like Davos from the world economic Forum it's not some Illuminati something something going on where some crazy parties and you know people controlling everything it's not really that I thought it was fun I learned a lot seeing behind the curtain seeing backstage I think was really cool and I'll keep sharing more of these insights with you anyway until next time bye",okay so most of my life I've hung out on the internet I was doing some math right I got an internet connection or dialup connection maybe when I was seven or 8 years old I've sat on MSN forums I've sat on Discord I've sat on X I've been on Reddit and it's just been

KNu2i6P44MI,This Hologram Tech is Transforming How We See,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNu2i6P44MI,"This technology from Star Wars just became real. For almost a decade, holograms have been a marketing gimmick. But what this Tokyo based startup Polalgraph has built feels like a portal to another world. Let me explain. So the core idea behind what Portal has done is that if you can track a person's head in 3D space, you can also track their eyes and render the scene from each point of view. Merge these two POVs together and the screen becomes a window almost like a portal. One you can peer around, lean into or walk past. You just put on a pair of lightweight LCD shutter glasses, while a Vive tracker or a webcam tracks your head. Then a 3D projector or monitor shows you two slightly different images, one for each eye, sync to your exact head position. The result, realtime motion parallax and depth. Lean left and you see behind the virtual object. Crouch and you're looking under it. Recently, they also showed off their flagship demo called Geoportal. It almost looks like a sand table, but what's projected onto it is a full-blown 3D miniature city. Now, with the speed technologies moving, I don't think we're far away from actually stepping inside virtual cities or maybe even playing Age of Empires on the table against our",This technology from Star Wars just became real For almost a decade holograms have been a marketing gimmick But what this Tokyo based startup Polalgraph has built feels like a portal to another world Let me explain So the core idea behind what Portal has done is that if you can track a person's head in 3D space you can also track their eyes and render the scene from each point of view Merge these two POVs together and the screen becomes a window almost like a portal One you can peer around lean into or walk past You just put on a pair of lightweight LCD shutter glasses while a Vive tracker or a webcam tracks your head Then a 3D projector or monitor shows you two slightly different images one for each eye sync to your exact head position The result realtime motion parallax and depth Lean left and you see behind the virtual object Crouch and you're looking under it Recently they also showed off their flagship demo called Geoportal It almost looks like a sand table but what's projected onto it is a full-blown 3D miniature city Now with the speed technologies moving I don't think we're far away from actually stepping inside virtual cities or maybe even playing Age of Empires on the table against our,
sNwjou1CUI0,Chinese Version Of Tesla Cybertruck!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNwjou1CUI0,"This Chinese version of Tesla's Cybert truck might actually be better than the original. It's called the Gak Pickup 01. And while it definitely borrows that stainless steel angular look, it packs some features Tesla doesn't have. Let me show you why this truck is so cool. First up, there's the smart suspension system. This truck has sensors that scan the road a thousand times every second. When it detects bumps or dips, it automatically adjusts each wheel independently to keep the body perfectly level. Then there is design, which is clearly inspired by Tesla with that distinctive stainless steel body that won't rust and doesn't need paint. Of course, Gak added its own style with sleek LED light strips across the front and back and chunky off-road tires that look ready for any adventure. Now, inside the car, it gets really interesting. The steering wheel can actually slide from the left side to the right side of the dashboard. This means they can sell the exact same truck in America, Australia, Japan, anywhere without making different versions for different markets. That's some clever engineering. However, Gak outshines Tesla in its adaptability. While Tesla locked their Cybert truck into one fixed layout, Gak completely rethought what a truck cabin could be. They created a modular system where you can slide different setups in and out depending on what you need that day. When it comes to raw power, GAK claims 12,000 new m of torque at the wheels. That's the force that gets you moving and pulling heavy loads. Tesla's Cybert truck edges ahead with 14,000 new m. But both trucks have more than enough power for most people's needs. Of course, there's a catch. While people are already driving Cybert trucks on American roads, the Gak Pickup01 is still just a concept that won't hit production until around 2027. Pricing hasn't been announced yet, but if Gak can land anywhere near the rumored sub $40,000 mark, it could make this thing a serious competitor to Tesla.",This Chinese version of Tesla's Cybert truck might actually be better than the original It's called the Gak Pickup 01 And while it definitely borrows that stainless steel angular look it packs some features Tesla doesn't have Let me show you why this truck is so cool First up there's the smart suspension system This truck has sensors that scan the road a thousand times every second When it detects bumps or dips it automatically adjusts each wheel independently to keep the body perfectly level Then there is design which is clearly inspired by Tesla with that distinctive stainless steel body that won't rust and doesn't need paint Of course Gak added its own style with sleek LED light strips across the front and back and chunky off-road tires that look ready for any adventure Now inside the car it gets really interesting The steering wheel can actually slide from the left side to the right side of the dashboard This means they can sell the exact same truck in America Australia Japan anywhere without making different versions for different markets That's some clever engineering However Gak outshines Tesla in its adaptability While Tesla locked their Cybert truck into one fixed layout Gak completely rethought what a truck cabin could be They created a modular system where you can slide different setups in and out depending on what you need that day When it comes to raw power GAK claims 12000 new m of torque at the wheels That's the force that gets you moving and pulling heavy loads Tesla's Cybert truck edges ahead with 14000 new m But both trucks have more than enough power for most people's needs Of course there's a catch While people are already driving Cybert trucks on American roads the Gak Pickup01 is still just a concept that won't hit production until around 2027 Pricing hasn't been announced yet but if Gak can land anywhere near the rumored sub $40000 mark it could make this thing a serious competitor to Tesla,
IFAdoXja4o0,The WORLD'S FIRST Video Edited by BRAIN WAVES!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFAdoXja4o0,"You're looking at the first ever video edited using only thoughts. This is the first video edited with the Neuralink. This is my old voice narrating this video cloned by AI from recordings before I lost my voice. This is Brad, an ALS patient who can't move or speak, but can somehow control his MacBook using just his thoughts thanks to Neuralink. It all starts with a tiny coinsized chip placed inside Brad's motor cortex, the part of the brain responsible for movement. Now, from this chip, about 1,024 ultra thin electrodes are inserted directly into the soft jelly-like brain matter, carefully listening to individual neurons. Now, every time Brad thinks about something, like moving his tongue or clenching his jaw, specific neurons activate. The electrodes then pick up this neural activity and send it to the chip where an AI decodes these signals and turns Brad's thoughts into precise cursor movements and clicks. What's mind-blowing is how this entire process happens every 15 milliseconds, which is as real time as it gets. But Brad didn't use it to just click around. He edited an entire video, dragging files, navigating menus, trimming clips, picking transitions, and even fine-tuning the timeline using nothing but his thoughts and an AI clone of his voice. What's even more impressive is that unlike eyetracking systems that don't work in bright light, Neuralink works anywhere. It doesn't care if you're indoors, outdoors, sitting, lying down. It just listens to your brain. That's it. And this is just the beginning. Imagine a future where two people could talk without even saying a word. where you could just think about something and the decoded signals could be sent directly to another person's implant and stimulate the right neurons, transmitting ideas directly with near zero information loss. It's both exciting and scary to think about how human communication will evolve in the coming decades.",You're looking at the first ever video edited using only thoughts This is the first video edited with the Neuralink This is my old voice narrating this video cloned by AI from recordings before I lost my voice This is Brad an ALS patient who can't move or speak but can somehow control his MacBook using just his thoughts thanks to Neuralink It all starts with a tiny coinsized chip placed inside Brad's motor cortex the part of the brain responsible for movement Now from this chip about 1024 ultra thin electrodes are inserted directly into the soft jelly-like brain matter carefully listening to individual neurons Now every time Brad thinks about something like moving his tongue or clenching his jaw specific neurons activate The electrodes then pick up this neural activity and send it to the chip where an AI decodes these signals and turns Brad's thoughts into precise cursor movements and clicks What's mind-blowing is how this entire process happens every 15 milliseconds which is as real time as it gets But Brad didn't use it to just click around He edited an entire video dragging files navigating menus trimming clips picking transitions and even fine-tuning the timeline using nothing but his thoughts and an AI clone of his voice What's even more impressive is that unlike eyetracking systems that don't work in bright light Neuralink works anywhere It doesn't care if you're indoors outdoors sitting lying down It just listens to your brain That's it And this is just the beginning Imagine a future where two people could talk without even saying a word where you could just think about something and the decoded signals could be sent directly to another person's implant and stimulate the right neurons transmitting ideas directly with near zero information loss It's both exciting and scary to think about how human communication will evolve in the coming decades,
xFvlUVkMPJY,"Sam Altman On Miyazaki’s thoughts on art, Design Jobs, Indian AI, Is Prompt Engineering A Job?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvlUVkMPJY,"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm with Sam Alman. And Sam, uh, I've seen a bunch of your tweets over the last few days. They're called posts now. They're called X's now. I don't know what they're called anymore. I don't know what they're called. I still call them tweets. You've been tweeting a lot about India. You've also been tweeting a lot about the new image gen. Firstly, I want to say I've had early access to the the photo image gen thing. It's been great. Everything from mood boarding, making images, UI, it's just been phenomenal. In fact, it's also very smart. So we've been we have this very clever use case where we're generating the front view of a 3D model and then asking it for the left side view, the right side view, the view behind and then we're throwing that into you know another model that generates the mesh and then reproing these textures on top and then also asking it to generate height maps which is just the insanity of this existing where it didn't exist a couple of months ago is just it it's it blows my mind. What's the response been like? Any numbers for us? I I don't know if I can share an exact number but like way more images than I thought the internet had uh like appetite to to do like the um we will cross a billion total images in the notistant future. I can say that. Oh man, that that's a huge number. And what's the response like any any creative use cases that you've seen on on images so far apart from you know animating yourself? Yeah, I I mean the the thing that's been exciting to me is just the breadth of creative use cases. Obviously turning yourself into anime was the one that kind of first lit up on the internet, but but it's been amazing to see the sort of creative expression, people making just really new kinds of images I had never thought about before. Um there's obviously a lot of great commercial use cases too where people are, you know, using this in their small business for new logos or graphic design or whatever. But but really the creative spirit of people just doing things that, you know, images, kinds of images that I've never seen exist before, that's that's been to me quite exciting. And and has India contributed? I mean I think India has been a big user of this from your tweets at least. India I I believe is our fastest growing market now. Um India's been been very special to us for a long time. Um India was one of the first markets outside the US that really jumped on AI in a huge huge way and since this moment has happened it is now our I'm pretty sure it's our fastest growing market. Wow. That's that's that's so it's been very cool to see. That's crazy too. And and have you seen Indians also use things outside of imagen? Have you seen them use deep research? Are they a paying market? Uh I was in India a couple of months ago and the that was obviously before image genen and you know it was like non-stop stories from people about what they were using chatbt for um what what they were using chatbt to do not catch 40. Um but but it was really it's like quite incredible the degree to which it has permeated Indian society for for all sorts of things. You know certainly we get feedback that our price point is too high for mass adoption in the Indian market and we're looking at things to do there. Unfortunately, our compute costs are still just quite high. But we are hard at work on more efficient models and I'm optimistic we'll be able to bring cost down over time. Amazing. And I want to touch upon the other side of this, right, which is the UI and design jobs for a second. You know, we thought when these tools come out came out a year ago that well, we're going to have, you know, these tools do most of the work for us. But, you know, in our own company, we have a bunch of people who are video editors. We have people who are designers and it turns out we still need a person to run the tool because humans still need accountability someone maintaining context and it's almost like the manager of the tool in some senses right uh is this how is this how jobs are going to evolve is have you seen something similar or do you have a do you have a path for how jobs will evolve now that these sort of tools are here I think it's going to be uneven and it'll be different for different kinds of jobs there will be some jobs that are that totally go away where the AI just does them end to And mostly I think it'll be a case of a new tool where people are just much more productive and can do work at a higher quality. So there will still be people that are in charge of you know making a website look great. But the expectations of how good a website looks just go up a lot and we all get better stuff. Uh in fact maybe we get more maybe there's more demand for that in a world like that that that I think can cut many different ways. Um and then there will be totally new classes of jobs that we just haven't seen before at all. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have examples so far? There are some kinds of customer support where I think an AI can just do that end to end and that'd be in the first category. In the second, since we're on this example of graphic designers, you know, taste still really matters and like the the you know, when we went from graphic designers had to do everything with like uh paper and pencil or you know, pens and paper, whatever you want to call it, to having computer tools, they were able to do more and do better, but we still needed a lot of good graphic design in the world. Um, we can now have a new tool, but and and no doubt it's going to change the workflow of a graphic designer and some things that some people were paid for, they won't be paid for those tasks. But what it appears to me will happen is you will still need some sort of job, which is, you know, make this website look beautiful. Um, and maybe there are fewer people that do that, but they make much more money. Maybe there are more people that do it because we just have a, you know, explosion of how many websites we can get. Like may maybe it turns out there was way more demand for graphic design in the world than than we could sort of like afford to fill. I think we just don't know on that yet. Um, and then there's other and then in terms of like entirely new jobs, you know, the first example we saw of that was prompt engineer. Before AI came along, there was no such thing as a prompt engineer. Not only that, there was no it would have been hard to conceptualize that there would be such a job. Um there's there's many more, but that's the example I give is the sort of near and dear to my heart one. And it's so funny when whenever some of these new jobs come in, they're always ridiculed at first, right? Like even building rappers, and we'll come to that in a bit, but even with prompt engineer, a lot of people still don't take it seriously. Well, all you're going to do is write English. Do you have a do you have a defense for that? Do you feel there's there's some way to, you know, make the people who are now going to be prompt engineers feel a little more, you know, like they're not losing status for doing it? When I was young, um, I knew I wanted to go study computer programming. And the adults in my life would say, ""Oh, that's like that's a hobby job. These computers aren't going to go anywhere. You need to go be a doctor or a lawyer. Like, you need to get a real stable job."" You know, this is like a this is a dangerous path to go down. Um, and I thought I understood something that they didn't. And I think I really encourage people to have their own conviction on what things are going to be like. And just because something is not a just because something is not a historically valuable or high status job doesn't mean it won't be in the future. Um this is this is like the way of technological progress. You know for people that are watching there's a post by Sam Alman on this which is the strength to be misunderstood. I love that that blog post by the way. So thank you so much for that. You wrote it many years ago. I think it was it was very insightful when I decided to become a content creator and it was a low status job back then. I was going to say about your job, you know, I remember, you know, like 10 years ago or something. Uh, I would like I would meet people I I was, you know, I would go talk about doing startups or whatever and I I would like go meet young people who wanted to start startups. And I always kind of like asked people what they wanted to be or what they thought the interesting industries were because I think if you kind of like ask young people that you get a you get a perspective that is interesting and different and usually right. And every not everybody many people said they wanted to be a YouTuber at the time. I was like what? But I I it hit me then that I'm like ah I cannot dismiss this like people dismissed computer programmer when I was young. Yeah. I I want to touch upon something else that the internet's been sort of debating over the last few days which is you know there's this video of Miyazaki. So of course it's an out of context video where he's looking at a model from you know many years ago something some creature thrashing around and he said that well you know I don't like this. Essentially that was the the you know the summary of what he said. you know, as an artist who's been making videos for n 9 years, I feel some of the craft and the, you know, the effort I'd have to put in to make an image or even to make a video has dropped over the years. And it is a little bit upsetting. It it feels like it's a little bit of a bummer as an artist, right? But as an entrepreneur, as somebody now that has a team to manage and worry about their salaries and payroll and whatnot, it is very good that this technology exists because it helps me go a little bit faster, right? It helps me, you know, make sure that I'm I'm dealing with a lot a lot less stress. Do you have a view on um, you know, how the internet should think about this evolving nature of art? I think what it was like to try to um do what you do 30 years ago. It was impossible or very hard. I mean, you'd need like a camcorder and like VHS tapes and then you'd have to like edit it in some complicated way. And then even if you did that, you would have to like distribute tapes because there was no internet and no YouTube or there wasn't internet but it wasn't very good. And now like anybody on earth can get a smartphone and record themselves and put it up and if they have something interesting to say they get it out there and the world benefits from that. Um I think the democratization of creating content has been a big netwin for society. It has not been a complete win. There are negative things about it for sure and certainly it did something about the the art form but I think on the whole it's been a win and this is something that I very deeply believe about the power of technology which is giving everyone more tools making things easier lowering the barriers to entry um does significantly increase the number of people that can contribute to society and we all benefit from that overall. Doesn't mean that it doesn't like cause some job loss and some people who had a sort of differential ability to do something now have a lot more competition, but overall I think it's a real benefit to society. Um my own experience of this was watching the barrier to entry to starting a company really change. Um, this happened when it got cheaper to start a company because of a whole bunch of things, but AWS was one of the biggest and most important moments. Access to the internet in general was was another big one. And there was a shift that Y Combinator I think really helped drive or popularize whatever you want to call it. uh starting in 2005 where young technical founders could all of a sudden much more easily start companies and that led to an explosion of great new products and technologies that the world got to benefit from. Now some of the people that those companies competed with probably wish that hadn't happened but as a citizen of the world there was a lot more stuff. OpenAI itself, I think, was an example of a company that only got to happen because the barriers to entry to a bunch of different pieces of technology stack got significantly low and this ragtag bunch of us were able to just do something we had no right to do. Yeah, I think I agree with you. I think especially after Stripe and in India after UPI, there's just been an explosion of new companies, new new types of things that were just not possible because the amount of red tape that it required to even get started. I assume now it's sort of become the same in design. In fact, on the note of YC, right, I actually, you know, I want to ask you to put on your 20-year-old when you were a 20-year-old hat of, you know, going to YC again. If you knew everything you knew right now and the debate was, you should build a rapper or no, you shouldn't build a rapper, OpenAI would probably kill your startup or on the other side, foundational models are worthless. Rappers are the only ones that are making money and able to raise money and whatnot. Um, what would you do knowing everything you knew, but also with the ability to shut out the noise? I think the whole like oh your startup is just a rapper or oh like people used to say that about other categories too. You know there was a time when people say well you're just a rapper on AWS probably. Um the people are building absolutely incredible new companies based off of AI. Most of them will fail or not do that well, but some of them will find a really enduring business and generate a ton of value. And that's that's always the case. That's just how the world work. Like, you know, most startups fail and some really succeed. And it's easy to sound smart and to just dismiss everything as a rapper or some thin thing that's not going to, you know, create much value. And I remember when people used to say very similar things about open AAI. Yeah. What was it? What was the they used to say? You're just, you know, you're just like a little research lab and Google's going to crush you and like you're just putting this like thin layer on or Nvidia is going to get all the value or you're going to like you're doing this like little thing and it's impossible to compete with the big tech companies. And it was not long ago they were saying this. This is a couple years ago. So I don't know. I it sounds very cool and sophisticated to always say why things aren't going to work and you will be right most of the time. Um and kind of the the most important lesson I think you can learn as an entrepreneur is that that or an investor is that that is not how great companies get built or invested in. So I think if I were 20 in NYC right now and someone was calling my company a GPT rapper, I'd be like, ""Ah, I'm I must be, you know, in a promising direction."" Do you do you have any specific ideas that you would be working on if you were 20? But you were not an open AI, you didn't have the resources. You had 500K. As a matter of principle, I try to never answer that question because I I the thing I care about most is that people don't start someone else's company. Like you you the ideas that I have for companies are probably mid at best. And the idea that some 20-year-old doing YC right now that has a company that has an idea for a company that sounds totally crazy and bad to me, that's probably the next open AI. And I never want to discourage anyone from that by saying some like safe middle of the road like out of touch idea. So go do your crazy idea. It's my advice. That makes sense. It's almost like you need to do what you're passionate about. Otherwise, you never end up building a Snapchat because everyone would think it was a bad idea on day one. Um, that's amazing, Sam. You know, we did a we did a podcast with Kevin, uh, your CPO the other day, and he gave me a timeline for when code is going to be automated. He said 2025. Anthropic said 2027. He said, ""No, we can do better. We'll do 2025 or maybe 2026."" Um, now that we know everything we know, do you have a timeline for when, you know, a lot of writing code becomes English? or is that not going to happen? I think it's the degree of automation that matters to get to 100 truly 100% automation. You know, you can make a complex thing and never touch code. That that's one thing, but I'm less interested in that question than when a coder becomes 10 times more productive. And I think that could happen this year, next year, something like that. So, a coder is 10x more productive. I think a coder is already several times more productive. I think there's already like at least in you know the way people around me have started working the good ones who've adopted the yeah people maybe say 2x 3x but I haven't heard anyone I haven't heard many people I have not heard a consensus for 10x yet but you think that by next year it's going to be a a 10x step function look predictions especially predictions with the timeline attached are always difficult but I think we can aim at that yeah interesting you know there's there is a negative side to this right which is that you know Daniel Grath had this this one article where he said that $250 billion of India's exports are actually IT services and if you think from that angle that could just be GBD4 tokens right or GDP5 tokens at some point for India that $250 billion is very important and not all of those engineers are building are are elite engineers who will benefit from this technology and go 10x right some of them are still building simple crab crowd apps and there is competition from the 10x engineer maybe not from AI itself but an engineer using the AI and sort of outpacing them and It's they're able to do this at much cheaper, right? Because the tokens are of course cheaper. Do you have something that India can do uh to actually make sure we absorb some of that? We we continue to be relevant there. If there's one area that I think I think this is an important general question, but if there's one area where I think that the world just has so much more demand than we can currently supply, it's for codewritten. My my belief is that the world just wants way more software and is about to get it. And if you give people these tools to write software much more effectively, I at least think for a while what will happen is someone who today can write code at some value will be able to write code or create software let's say at some much higher value. Now they have to pay the AI a lot so they won't capture all of that. Um and also the market price for a piece of code will go down. But I I would bet this is an example. Everyone seems obsessed with Jevans paradox all of a sudden and I would bet this will be an example of it. So a lot more software being built. So this it might it might the cost might drop a certain amount but then also demand goes up by that amount. I think so. Interesting. That's very reassuring to hear actually. I don't think it's going to be like that. I don't I don't want to like dodge the question because I don't think it'll be like that in every industry but code is one where I would guess it's like that. And and do you see a lot of these I mean we've been seeing sort of early agents right? We've seen deep research. D research has been great but DP is also a passive agent. It's not taking my card and doing something with it. So there's there's low DP research is low risk. Um I've seen that you have been very bullish about agents. There are lots of businesses that have been very bullish about lots of other companies that have been bullish about agents. Um do you have do you have something in mind for what agents will become over the end of this year or by by next year and some use cases that you think we'll see on an everyday basis with agents? Just to stick with the code example because we're on that. I I think this idea that you can like say to a coding agent um I would like this new feature built and it goes off and pings you back you know some period of time later and says okay here's the pull request ready to go that I think will feel very crazy to people there's other categories where it kind of goes off and does stuff for you on the internet operator points at that a little bit um but I would expect the coding one to be a big a big anything on a consumer use case like something like booking your your food or something ordering a cab or something like that. That's the kind of thing that I very much expect to happen and that that'll feel like a very agentic task. Let me ask you another question which is if you were an employee at a job but you were working at a legacy company let's say they were slow to adopt all this technology they're not even aware that you know maybe they've tried it in passing they've seen a GPD3 and they've become dismissive about and lots of legacy companies are like this if you were sitting in that company and you were unable to convince your company to use these new tools because of bureaucracy or whatever reason would you what would your career plan be then would you move to a faster moving company but also you know take on the risk of that company probably I would do that. Yeah. Both because I think companies that don't adopt these things will be in a tough place. Most I mean, there's some categories of companies that of course be fine, but also because I'd want to be responsible for my own career success and I'd want to make sure I was learning and you know, if I felt like I was not getting exposure to these tools, it would seem super broken. That makes sense. Okay, one last question and then we should be good. Um, can you give me a counterintuitive insight you've had about AI? worked here for a very long time of your life and you've done a bunch of things. You've done YC where you've invested in companies. You've you've you've been around the valley for a very long period of time. What is something you thought about AI but you have a totally different experience now? I somehow thought it was going to be a bigger change to society than it's turned out to be. Um, you know, I I I I had this sort of like sci-fi like vision of what AI was going to be like. And maybe it'll still get there, but right now it's just this like crazy powerful tool. And life goes on mostly the same. And and I'm actually very happy about that. I think that's good. I think I was naive before. I also think that would have been bad. But it's it it's very different than I kind of imagined it 10 years ago. But I think I think that's wonderful. Yeah, I think that's wonderful, too. I think you know having godlike technology being able to solve at some point medicine and help us do less of the work we hate but more of the work we enjoy I think is is is net good and I hope that you know everyone benefits from it at some point. Um thank you Sam. Uh this was this was a wonderful interview. Thank you so much for being support and and doing this you know on such short notice and I hope uh I hope you know India continues to use this technology and I I have no doubt I I I what is happening with this technology in India I I have uh I've never seen adoption like this of anything anywhere and it's very cool. Yeah, I really hope we do more of that and I hope you know we put it all over the timeline and and you know you see some of the things we you created. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks Sam. Bye.","Ladies and gentlemen I'm with Sam Alman And Sam uh I've seen a bunch of your tweets over the last few days They're called posts now They're called X's now I don't know what they're called anymore I don't know what they're called I still call them tweets You've been tweeting a lot about India You've also been tweeting a lot about the new image gen Firstly I want to say I've had early access to the the photo image gen thing It's been great Everything from mood boarding making images UI it's just been phenomenal In fact it's also very smart So we've been we have this very clever use case where we're generating the front view of a 3D model and then asking it for the left side view the right side view the view behind and then we're throwing that into you know another model that generates the mesh and then reproing these textures on top and then also asking it to generate height maps which is just the insanity of this existing where it didn't exist a couple of months ago is just it it's it blows my mind What's the response been like Any numbers for us I I don't know if I can share an exact number but like way more images than I thought the internet had uh like appetite to to do like the um we will cross a billion total images in the notistant future I can say that Oh man that that's a huge number And what's the response like any any creative use cases that you've seen on on images so far apart from you know animating yourself Yeah I I mean the the thing that's been exciting to me is just the breadth of creative use cases Obviously turning yourself into anime was the one that kind of first lit up on the internet but but it's been amazing to see the sort of creative expression people making just really new kinds of images I had never thought about before Um there's obviously a lot of great commercial use cases too where people are you know using this in their small business for new logos or graphic design or whatever But but really the creative spirit of people just doing things that you know images kinds of images that I've never seen exist before that's that's been to me quite exciting And and has India contributed I mean I think India has been a big user of this from your tweets at least India I I believe is our fastest growing market now Um India's been been very special to us for a long time Um India was one of the first markets outside the US that really jumped on AI in a huge huge way and since this moment has happened it is now our I'm pretty sure it's our fastest growing market Wow That's that's that's so it's been very cool to see That's crazy too And and have you seen Indians also use things outside of imagen Have you seen them use deep research Are they a paying market Uh I was in India a couple of months ago and the that was obviously before image genen and you know it was like non-stop stories from people about what they were using chatbt for um what what they were using chatbt to do not catch 40 Um but but it was really it's like quite incredible the degree to which it has permeated Indian society for for all sorts of things You know certainly we get feedback that our price point is too high for mass adoption in the Indian market and we're looking at things to do there Unfortunately our compute costs are still just quite high But we are hard at work on more efficient models and I'm optimistic we'll be able to bring cost down over time Amazing And I want to touch upon the other side of this right which is the UI and design jobs for a second You know we thought when these tools come out came out a year ago that well we're going to have you know these tools do most of the work for us But you know in our own company we have a bunch of people who are video editors We have people who are designers and it turns out we still need a person to run the tool because humans still need accountability someone maintaining context and it's almost like the manager of the tool in some senses right uh is this how is this how jobs are going to evolve is have you seen something similar or do you have a do you have a path for how jobs will evolve now that these sort of tools are here I think it's going to be uneven and it'll be different for different kinds of jobs there will be some jobs that are that totally go away where the AI just does them end to And mostly I think it'll be a case of a new tool where people are just much more productive and can do work at a higher quality So there will still be people that are in charge of you know making a website look great But the expectations of how good a website looks just go up a lot and we all get better stuff Uh in fact maybe we get more maybe there's more demand for that in a world like that that that I think can cut many different ways Um and then there will be totally new classes of jobs that we just haven't seen before at all Yeah Yeah Do you have examples so far There are some kinds of customer support where I think an AI can just do that end to end and that'd be in the first category In the second since we're on this example of graphic designers you know taste still really matters and like the the you know when we went from graphic designers had to do everything with like uh paper and pencil or you know pens and paper whatever you want to call it to having computer tools they were able to do more and do better but we still needed a lot of good graphic design in the world Um we can now have a new tool but and and no doubt it's going to change the workflow of a graphic designer and some things that some people were paid for they won't be paid for those tasks But what it appears to me will happen is you will still need some sort of job which is you know make this website look beautiful Um and maybe there are fewer people that do that but they make much more money Maybe there are more people that do it because we just have a you know explosion of how many websites we can get Like may maybe it turns out there was way more demand for graphic design in the world than than we could sort of like afford to fill I think we just don't know on that yet Um and then there's other and then in terms of like entirely new jobs you know the first example we saw of that was prompt engineer Before AI came along there was no such thing as a prompt engineer Not only that there was no it would have been hard to conceptualize that there would be such a job Um there's there's many more but that's the example I give is the sort of near and dear to my heart one And it's so funny when whenever some of these new jobs come in they're always ridiculed at first right Like even building rappers and we'll come to that in a bit but even with prompt engineer a lot of people still don't take it seriously Well all you're going to do is write English Do you have a do you have a defense for that Do you feel there's there's some way to you know make the people who are now going to be prompt engineers feel a little more you know like they're not losing status for doing it When I was young um I knew I wanted to go study computer programming And the adults in my life would say ""Oh that's like that's a hobby job These computers aren't going to go anywhere You need to go be a doctor or a lawyer Like you need to get a real stable job"" You know this is like a this is a dangerous path to go down Um and I thought I understood something that they didn't And I think I really encourage people to have their own conviction on what things are going to be like And just because something is not a just because something is not a historically valuable or high status job doesn't mean it won't be in the future Um this is this is like the way of technological progress You know for people that are watching there's a post by Sam Alman on this which is the strength to be misunderstood I love that that blog post by the way So thank you so much for that You wrote it many years ago I think it was it was very insightful when I decided to become a content creator and it was a low status job back then I was going to say about your job you know I remember you know like 10 years ago or something Uh I would like I would meet people I I was you know I would go talk about doing startups or whatever and I I would like go meet young people who wanted to start startups And I always kind of like asked people what they wanted to be or what they thought the interesting industries were because I think if you kind of like ask young people that you get a you get a perspective that is interesting and different and usually right And every not everybody many people said they wanted to be a YouTuber at the time I was like what But I I it hit me then that I'm like ah I cannot dismiss this like people dismissed computer programmer when I was young Yeah I I want to touch upon something else that the internet's been sort of debating over the last few days which is you know there's this video of Miyazaki So of course it's an out of context video where he's looking at a model from you know many years ago something some creature thrashing around and he said that well you know I don't like this Essentially that was the the you know the summary of what he said you know as an artist who's been making videos for n 9 years I feel some of the craft and the you know the effort I'd have to put in to make an image or even to make a video has dropped over the years And it is a little bit upsetting It it feels like it's a little bit of a bummer as an artist right But as an entrepreneur as somebody now that has a team to manage and worry about their salaries and payroll and whatnot it is very good that this technology exists because it helps me go a little bit faster right It helps me you know make sure that I'm I'm dealing with a lot a lot less stress Do you have a view on um you know how the internet should think about this evolving nature of art I think what it was like to try to um do what you do 30 years ago It was impossible or very hard I mean you'd need like a camcorder and like VHS tapes and then you'd have to like edit it in some complicated way And then even if you did that you would have to like distribute tapes because there was no internet and no YouTube or there wasn't internet but it wasn't very good And now like anybody on earth can get a smartphone and record themselves and put it up and if they have something interesting to say they get it out there and the world benefits from that Um I think the democratization of creating content has been a big netwin for society It has not been a complete win There are negative things about it for sure and certainly it did something about the the art form but I think on the whole it's been a win and this is something that I very deeply believe about the power of technology which is giving everyone more tools making things easier lowering the barriers to entry um does significantly increase the number of people that can contribute to society and we all benefit from that overall Doesn't mean that it doesn't like cause some job loss and some people who had a sort of differential ability to do something now have a lot more competition but overall I think it's a real benefit to society Um my own experience of this was watching the barrier to entry to starting a company really change Um this happened when it got cheaper to start a company because of a whole bunch of things but AWS was one of the biggest and most important moments Access to the internet in general was was another big one And there was a shift that Y Combinator I think really helped drive or popularize whatever you want to call it uh starting in 2005 where young technical founders could all of a sudden much more easily start companies and that led to an explosion of great new products and technologies that the world got to benefit from Now some of the people that those companies competed with probably wish that hadn't happened but as a citizen of the world there was a lot more stuff OpenAI itself I think was an example of a company that only got to happen because the barriers to entry to a bunch of different pieces of technology stack got significantly low and this ragtag bunch of us were able to just do something we had no right to do Yeah I think I agree with you I think especially after Stripe and in India after UPI there's just been an explosion of new companies new new types of things that were just not possible because the amount of red tape that it required to even get started I assume now it's sort of become the same in design In fact on the note of YC right I actually you know I want to ask you to put on your 20-year-old when you were a 20-year-old hat of you know going to YC again If you knew everything you knew right now and the debate was you should build a rapper or no you shouldn't build a rapper OpenAI would probably kill your startup or on the other side foundational models are worthless Rappers are the only ones that are making money and able to raise money and whatnot Um what would you do knowing everything you knew but also with the ability to shut out the noise I think the whole like oh your startup is just a rapper or oh like people used to say that about other categories too You know there was a time when people say well you're just a rapper on AWS probably Um the people are building absolutely incredible new companies based off of AI Most of them will fail or not do that well but some of them will find a really enduring business and generate a ton of value And that's that's always the case That's just how the world work Like you know most startups fail and some really succeed And it's easy to sound smart and to just dismiss everything as a rapper or some thin thing that's not going to you know create much value And I remember when people used to say very similar things about open AAI Yeah What was it What was the they used to say You're just you know you're just like a little research lab and Google's going to crush you and like you're just putting this like thin layer on or Nvidia is going to get all the value or you're going to like you're doing this like little thing and it's impossible to compete with the big tech companies And it was not long ago they were saying this This is a couple years ago So I don't know I it sounds very cool and sophisticated to always say why things aren't going to work and you will be right most of the time Um and kind of the the most important lesson I think you can learn as an entrepreneur is that that or an investor is that that is not how great companies get built or invested in So I think if I were 20 in NYC right now and someone was calling my company a GPT rapper I'd be like ""Ah I'm I must be you know in a promising direction"" Do you do you have any specific ideas that you would be working on if you were 20 But you were not an open AI you didn't have the resources You had 500K As a matter of principle I try to never answer that question because I I the thing I care about most is that people don't start someone else's company Like you you the ideas that I have for companies are probably mid at best And the idea that some 20-year-old doing YC right now that has a company that has an idea for a company that sounds totally crazy and bad to me that's probably the next open AI And I never want to discourage anyone from that by saying some like safe middle of the road like out of touch idea So go do your crazy idea It's my advice That makes sense It's almost like you need to do what you're passionate about Otherwise you never end up building a Snapchat because everyone would think it was a bad idea on day one Um that's amazing Sam You know we did a we did a podcast with Kevin uh your CPO the other day and he gave me a timeline for when code is going to be automated He said 2025 Anthropic said 2027 He said ""No we can do better We'll do 2025 or maybe 2026"" Um now that we know

yet but you think that by next year it's going to be a a 10x step function look predictions especially predictions with the timeline attached are always difficult but I think we can aim at that yeah interesting you know there's there is a negative side to this right which is that you know Daniel Grath had this this one article where he said that $250 billion of India's exports are actually IT services and if you think from that angle that could just be GBD4 tokens right or GDP5 tokens at some point for India that $250 billion is very important and not all of those engineers are building are are elite engineers who will benefit from this technology and go 10x right some of them are still building simple crab crowd apps and there is competition from the 10x engineer maybe not from AI itself but an engineer using the AI and sort of outpacing them and It's they're able to do this at much cheaper right Because the tokens are of course cheaper Do you have something that India can do

-Sruwwv6bnw,How To Build A Country,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Sruwwv6bnw,"[Music] 8 5 4 3 2 1 so I have my handy little spaceship here and as you can see that is Singapore in 1965 it's a tiny island nation it was unexpectedly expelled from Malaysia it had virtually no resources no natural wealth no standing army and the unemployment there was through the roof at that time it was even poorer than India most experts believed this country would [Music] fail warning calculating Quantum coordinates but instead as you can see it evolved into one of the wealthiest Nations on Earth within a single generation this was a mut flat swamp today this is a modern city this is the story of Singapore more importantly it's a master class in creating something extraordinary out of nothing and this same blueprint can even guide entrepreneurs today Singapore wasn't built like a traditional country it was built like a startup leuan U the architect of this transformation approached nation building like a CEO scales his company the principles he deployed to turn Singapore around are the same principles you and I as entrepreneurs can apply to build businesses in this video I'll break down the lessons behind Singapore's transformation and actually show you which parts of this you can take back into your entrepreneurial life this is my country this is my life this is my people now the of this video was made using the Intel Core Ultra laptops more on that later Singapore's Journey starts with Independence and it's a little bit of a complicated one at that point about 14% of singaporeans were unemployed the rest were kind of employed but not really in a way that contributed well to the economy and it was way worse than India at that time the economy mostly relied on being the middleman in regional trade and you know that's a very risky thing because unless you produce your own Goods you'll always be the middleman helping trade goods between different nations now before independence the British military was basically a Lifeline for Singapore's economy it is estimated that around 40,000 people were directly employed by the British forces so when Britain announced in 1968 that they'd be completely withdrawing from Singapore by 1971 it puts Singapore under the threat of having even higher unemployment so what leanu figured out was that if they wanted to survive they need to do two things first they had to leave from the region and create trade relations with the developed World they needed to connect with developed Nations and the path was to bring multinational companies which is mnc's to set up shop at that time just like now mnc's weren't exactly seen as Heroes if you go to social media today and see the concept of India bringing mnc's from outside here a lot of people think that there's a reputation for exploiting cheap labor and resources it feels like colonialism again which is why Indians and even singaporeans at that time had an a verion to Bringing mnc's they're like yo this is exactly like bringing the British back isn't it but leanu knew he had a problem to solve so he couldn't be stuck in these theoretical debates he had to put food on the table of 2 million people lean you understood marketing and he realized that if he could position Singapore with first class standards in public security health education transportation and services it would not only attract professionals here to keep doing more of what they're doing to make more money but also the mnc's outside to come into the city he needed to make the place look good they couldn't just be as good as their neighbors they had to be better they had to offer something extra to make it worthwhile for companies to set up shop so the government played a key role in attracting foreign investment they provided these mnc's with well planned commercial Estates incentives and even export promotions most importantly they established good Labor Relations which is what private Enterprise really wants and allows them to operate successfully one such example was the jurang Industrial estate it was 9,000 acres of land with roads sewage drainage Power and Water all laid out in 1968 American Semiconductor Company Texas Instruments wanted to come set up a plant to assemble semiconductors which was a high-tech product at that time and still is and were able to start production within just 50 days soon followed another American company National semiconductors another one of these companies was HP every single story of how Singapore is so welcoming to mnc's brought the next mnc's these stories traveled through the boardrooms of American Electronics Industries and Investments started flowing in by the end of 1970 they had issued 390 Pioneer certificates to businesses and also offered them tax-free status for a bit this all sounds crazy why are incentivizing businesses so much but all of that led to the economy getting better this is the thing right when government offers subsidies or when they bring in mnc's most of of us don't like it in the short term but it's always the better decision in the long term because it creates jobs those jobs create disposable income creating more jobs for the next year of the country so Lee mentions in his book that visiting CEOs used to call him before investing he says that the best way to convince them was to ensure that the roads from the airport to the hotel were clean and full of greenery so this is Lee's idea and it's so templatized now so if you see any new airport in any new city the distance between the airport and and the hotels is always covered in Greenery you want to show new people visiting that this is a good place to come invest your money and run your business but at that time this site was not common in developing countries he wanted to show the world that singaporeans were competent reliable and disciplined he knew he had to Market this as a skill to the rest of the world and he also said these people are ready to do what is required by these mnc's and sure enough by 1971 just a few years after this massive effort had began the unemployment situation had been completely turned around even when the British pulled out and left 30,000 workers jobless unemployment did not Spike and by 1997 Singapore had nearly 200 American manufacturers investing over $19 billion the us became Singapore's largest investor and the tech and Manufacturing Industries kept upgrading their skills and products which helped raise wages without sacrificing compared invests but it gets better just a few years after they had dealt with unemployment Lee removed any subsidies that were in place to protect local businesses and help them compete with mnc's you know what every country does they always give the local businesses more of a stimulus versus mnc's they say these are our own people we should make sure that we stimulate them so they produce more things internally but he understood something he understood that if Singapore had to become a competitive first world country they could not have subsidized underperforming businesses but Lee didn't do this he did not hesitate to let their local businesses close down if they were not competent enough it's like the participation prize in a race right if as a parent you keep giving your kids participation prizes or keep letting them completely win races when they actually go out in the real world they're going to be useless so Lee knew this that if I keep stimulating these businesses and keep you know patting them on the back they're not going to be very useful when the time comes where Singapore actually has to defend itself globally but of course you can't let your local businesses completely die so here's what he did and this is genius what he said was that when it came to develop new domestic Industries he picked the best students then sent them abroad to study at the best universities in Britain Canada Germany America he made them work in some mnc's and when they came back then they were given the opportunity to start companies like Neptune Orient lines which is a shipping line and Singapore International Airlines he said let's take good talent let's send them abroad let's make them really really good then bring them back and give them entrepreneurial opportunities and subsidies these Enterprises were not run like government operated companies it was made clear that they had to be profitable and not be at the mercy of subsidies or be shut down again emphasizing the need for meritocracy both of these Enterprises went on to become highly profitable businesses by achieving all of this in a decade Le's government sent a clear message to everyone outside we are fair we're competent we're trustworthy we get marketing okay so those were the economic decision that accelerated Singapore's growth but that wasn't enough you can't achieve ambitious goals as something like Singapore without instilling certain values in your people whether it's a company or a country it's all about culture see Lee believed in socialism early on he thought you know if you make 10 rupes it should be divided equally among everybody but over time he realized that personal motivation and rewards were essential for a productive economy some people are lazier and some people are more motivated to do more work now his goal was to give every citizen a stake in the country and its future for example one of the things is he wanted a home owning Society he saw how poorly maintained and misused blocks of low rental apartments were compared to homes owned by proud homeowners he noticed that when someone owned a home they treated their home and to some extent their neighboring areas with care if everyone would own homes the streets would be clean and he saw this right he was like if somebody owned a home they' keep their house and everything slightly outside clean now all 10 people on the Block own their own homes they' keep the entire Street clean if the entire country owned homes they would keep the country clean whereas on the other hand if someone rents they do not care much about their home and they definitely don't care about the street he was convinced that if everyone owned a home the country would be more stable when people own something they take care of it now the British government had started a central Provident fund it was a simple savings scheme for retirement 5% of the wage was contributed by the employee and 5% was matched by the employer and this will be withdrawn at 55 quite similar to how it works in India but Lee decided to expand this compulsory scheme into a fund that will enable every worker to own a home in 1968 the compulsory Savings in the fund was increased and the Housing Development board or the hdb launched a new revamped home ownership scheme which with this workers were allowed to use their cpf savings to pay 20% of a home's cost as a down payment and pay the remaining amount in Emi over 20 years they created beautiful housing with different layout options a community center and a food court the number of people who wanted to buy a new hdb apartment Grew From 3,000 when it began to 70,000 in 1996 by 1997 the country had 725,000 hdb apartments only only 9% of which were rented out the rest were all owner occupied if Lee had been more like a finance influencer and basically just been about renting it would have been a very different set of streets that you would be looking at on its journey to becoming what it is today Singapore also had to deal with unions interestingly lewu himself started his political life fighting for unions as an adviser negotiator by the mid 1950s the Communists had gained control control of most unions in Singapore remember communism was on the rise at that time Russia China Cuba Vietnam were all adopting communism there was no way Singapore could attract capitalist Western Investments without freeing unions from communist control Lee points out that the consequences of unfair demands from unions were serious including unemployment poorly thought out demands led to ridiculous situations like cleaning workers deliberately letting garbage pile up right before public holidays to ensure they'd get triple pay for working on those days if these practices continued no foreign business would have come to Singapore Lee insisted that union leaders must not kill the Golden Goose that lays the golden eggs he knew that workers needed New Attitudes you can't work in a company and say oh screw you pay me that's your responsibility he knew that they had to add value to the companies coming in Pay needed to align with performance not just time spent on the job Singapore's government couldn't allow situations like go to jeopardize the country's survival this problem with unions still exists today recently the New York Times Tech Guild a union of over 600 Tech employees announced that they might organize a strike on Election Day if their demands aren't met these demands include a 4-day work week unlimited sick leave and leave to grieve if their pet dies remember the average salary of a tech employee at nyt is $190,000 if the company accept these demands it would cost them $100 million more than these problems were dealt with headon by the Singapore government they laid out Provisions for rest days public holidays work cars and also made leave policies they made it illegal for a trade Union to call for a strike without holding an anonymous vote this stopped the practice of voting by open show of hands where those who didn't agree with the Union were intimidated into compliance this happens all the time if you allow everyone into Union to show their votes if somebody votes against a strike the union starts bullying that person inside the Union when it's blinded votes people can actually be honest because the government was able to make these tough decisions early they avoided the entitled welfare mindset that many other countries have gotten into and were able to create a virtuous cycle of low expenditure High savings low welfare High investment where the people who worked in companies actually felt proud of what they did instead of constantly calling it exploitation and actually driving away the mnc's which eventually leads to a worse country at the end of it but none of these reforms would have been sustainable without Singapore's commitment to a clean and Incorruptible government leak wanu knew that corruption destroy the country from within nobody understands this as much as we Indians Singapore was determined not to fall into the same trap to keep the government free from corruption Lee made a bold and controversial move he decided to pay government ministers and civil servants competitive private sector level wages like think about it right his rational is simple if Singapore wanted the best talent to run the country it had to compete with the private sector you want the best talent you don't want them going to a private sector job and getting paid five times more low pay would only incentivize corruption by a getting incompetent people to apply for the roles and B making bribes more attractive he also understood that their highly qualified ministers would not stay in office for long if they made a fraction of what they could make in the private sector they had to be extremely well paid and this is the one thing that I don't understand about India which is if you want the best people to be in government pay them as well as the best companies would pay them that's the only way you're going to get the best and that's the reason why you end up getting incompetent people who anyway end up taking bribes and end up cheating the system to make more money one more thing that Singapore did which I think is very relevant to India was that Singapore was able to create a sense of Oneness among people of different diverse backgrounds crucial for a country which was very very divided cuz see Singapore at this time there were no native people there were Native people but this very very small minority Singapore was actually composed of three factions the first one and the largest one was the Chinese the second one was a bunch of Malaysians and third was Indians and these three just did not get along so how do you create National Unity when these three communities don't get along they were able to get them to work together despite communal tensions because of their choice of working language and that choice was English so remember I told you Singapore used to have a lot of communal rights a lot of that was dependent on language the Chinese couldn't really understand the Malaysians the Malaysians couldn't really understand the Indians very well and it always felt like there were three different communities even so he knew that English was the best common language to use because it would prevent conflict he knew that all languages had some sentiment associated with them all regional languages has some sentiment so he said if you make the national language Chinese some people are going to end up feeling bad if you make it m other people are going to end up feeling bad so he just chose English he said the best thing that the britishers gave gave us was this language that nobody is passionate towards no Regional Chinese person or no Regional Indian would go out there and defend English or fight for it so the fighting was reduced secondly it also happened to be the language of business it was the language of diplomacy Science and Technology all the papers were published in it so the fact that nobody was passionate about English and it was actually commercially valuable he said we're going to make this the language that all of us are kind of disappointed in but nobody really cares about enough to fight about if he had picked any other language there would be communal tens because of this he also made all the schools change their language of teaching to English having said that there was still some Pockets where they encouraged Regional languages so that they didn't become completely westernized I'm speaking to you in English because I know you're not passionate about it cuz I know you're not going to get offended about it and we can just get information transfer which is what I do you know as a content creator I'm transferring information and stories to you I can do it in a language that you're not going to attach your sentiment to or get offended by another one of the debatable aspects of leewan news policies was the way he went after his critics he viewed criticism not only as an attack on him on his leadership but also as a threat to Singapore's progress he was one of the few leaders of state to legally pursue those who made defamatory statements or published misleading information and would often use lawsuits as a means to maintain control over narrative he believed that allowing false accusations or unchecked media Freedom could destabilize the government and erode public trust he felt that it was not in Singapore's interest to have every single policy taken apart and criticized he knew that Singapore had a big challenge ahead of it and he would have to make some unpopular decisions like for example getting the mnc's to the country some of which the masses would not agree with he argued against the Western notion of a free press criticizing what he saw as corruption and bias in the media system of the Western countries he believed that the Western press which was often idealized as a pillar of democracy was not without its flaws it was susceptible to sensationalism corporate interests and of course political bias it's so easy to get a paid article out now imagine back in those times where things were far less transparent these problems of cancel culture and trial by the masses are not new things today it is almost impossible to reply to every criticism you face on the internet but he went after everyone almost everyone who he thought might have defamed him a lot of people debate whether he was too authoritarian but at the same time if you put someone in a position where the only way to prove your innocence is by suing the newspapers or reducing their circulation people people who wrote critical articles about you you kind of also leave them with no choice having said that some of his actions in the media were definitely borderline dictatorship right at the end of the day we can all debate about this but we well aware of the effects of fake news on countries like ours as well where during elections we don't know what to believe and everyone seems strongly biased towards their side of the story I see how susceptible it is to bias because I know some of the people that stories are being written off and I know they're totally different in real life versus what you know the story says so I've seen these differences to know enough that you should go and defend yourself and your integrity if absolutely necessary of course there's a level of scale Beyond which it doesn't make sense because there's just too many people saying it at least with the media piece my role here isn't to tell you whether it's right or wrong I wanted to leave you with the story of Liu on youu and what it actually takes to take a developing country and make it a developed country Singapore succeeded because they were willing to make unpopular decisions that a lot of people don't agree with things like renting things like marriage a lot of people don't with a lot of that and he made these decisions for the long-term good of the country they did not Pander to the public just to win the next elections they did things that would benefit the country they realize that you can't have people who want to live their entire life in the union mindset you cannot have people think that somehow if we all Bann together we would make money out of thin air it only comes through Enterprise he also ran the country like one should run a business from marketing to the economic policies to even with the way you deal with unions and the media it was run like a company it was run like a tight ship think about it making the roads green and filled with Greenery for MNC XX to come see was a marketing decision almost nobody in the early days would bet on Singapore to succeed but Lee proved everyone Wrong by running it exactly like you would run a business but the key takeaway from Singapore success is not about the policies themselves but the values that underpin them personal responsibility meritocracy Integrity ownership Singapore thrived because its leaders dared to make difficult decisions there were two reasons I want to cover the story right one is because it shows you how much of Singapore's success is by doing things that the masses didn't fully agree with at that time and secondly I want to show you how much of success is also Having the courage as one person Leu on you as one person to not listen to the masses and do what you think is right anyway right and to show you that if you do what you think is right for a particular cause for a very very long period of time get the right people involved and really work hard to make it happen then you have Miracles like Singapore so now I'm super excited to tell you how we made this beautiful intro you just saw when you see someone moving through an incredible CGI environment you're actually watching two completely different things merge together and let me show you how we did it on these Intel AI PCS so before we even started filming we used AI specifically stable diffusion to plan our shots we typed in our ideas and it helped us visualize exactly how we wanted our story to look now the first real challenge is to analyze our footage and match every single detail of how the light and color hit our subject this is crucial because it tells our AI PC exactly how to make everything blend seamlessly but here's where it gets really cool we're using Unreal Engine to build our world it's incredible because it lets us see our digital environments in real time the clever part is matching our virtual camera to our real one we take the exact same lens data we used while filming and put it into unreal this makes sure our digital world moves and behaves exactly like our real footage finally we bring everything into After Effects that's where we composite all the elements together and add that final polish that makes your brain believe it's all one perfect shot now what's incredible is how our aipc handles all this with its specialized Intel Core Ultra processors working together we can preview our environments instantly at Cinema quality even with complex Lighting in physics there's practically zero waiting time now what's really exciting is how this Tech is transforming content creation these new processors aren't just faster than specifically designed to handle compute intensive tasks that help creators like us work more efficiently it's amazing to see how far we've come from spending hours on manual edits to having intelligent tools that help us focus on what matters most telling great stories",Music 8 5 4 3 2 1 so I have my handy little spaceship here and as you can see that is Singapore in 1965 it's a tiny island nation it was unexpectedly expelled from Malaysia it had virtually no resources no natural wealth no standing army and the unemployment there was through the roof at that time it was even poorer than India most experts believed this country would Music fail warning calculating Quantum coordinates but instead as you can see it evolved into one of the wealthiest Nations on Earth within a single generation this was a mut flat swamp today this is a modern city this is the story of Singapore more importantly it's a master class in creating something extraordinary out of nothing and this same blueprint can even guide entrepreneurs today Singapore wasn't built like a traditional country it was built like a startup leuan U the architect of this transformation approached nation building like a CEO scales his company the principles he deployed to turn Singapore around are the same principles you and I as entrepreneurs can apply to build businesses in this video I'll break down the lessons behind Singapore's transformation and actually show you which parts of this you can take back into your entrepreneurial life this is my country this is my life this is my people now the of this video was made using the Intel Core Ultra laptops more on that later Singapore's Journey starts with Independence and it's a little bit of a complicated one at that point about 14% of singaporeans were unemployed the rest were kind of employed but not really in a way

isn't it but leanu knew he had a problem to solve so he couldn't be stuck in these theoretical debates he had to put food on the table of 2 million people lean you understood marketing and he realized that if he could position Singapore with first class standards in public security health education transportation and services it would not only attract professionals here to keep doing more of what they're doing to make more money but also the mnc's outside to come into the city he needed to make the place look good they couldn't just be as good as their neighbors they had to be better they had

don't like it in the short term but it's always the better decision in the long term because it creates jobs those jobs create disposable income creating more jobs for the next year of the country so Lee mentions in his book that visiting CEOs used to call him before investing he says that the best way to convince them was to ensure that the roads from the airport to the hotel were clean and full of greenery so this is Lee's idea and it's so templatized now so if you see any new airport in any new city the distance between the airport and and the hotels is always covered in Greenery you want to show new people visiting that this is a good place to come invest your money and run your business but at that time this site was not common in developing countries he wanted to show the world that singaporeans were competent reliable and disciplined he knew he had to Market this as a skill to the rest of the world and he also said these people are ready to do what is required by these mnc's and sure enough by 1971 just a few years after this massive effort had began the unemployment situation had been completely turned around even when the British pulled out and left 30000 workers jobless unemployment did not Spike and by 1997 Singapore had nearly 200 American manufacturers investing over $19 billion the us became Singapore's largest investor and the tech and Manufacturing Industries kept upgrading their skills and products which helped raise wages without sacrificing compared invests but it gets better just a few years after they had dealt with unemployment Lee removed any subsidies that were in place to protect local businesses and help them compete with mnc's you know what every country does they always give the local businesses more of a stimulus versus mnc's they say these are our own people we should make sure that we stimulate them so they produce more things internally but he understood something he understood that if Singapore had to become a competitive first world country they could not have subsidized underperforming businesses but Lee didn't do this he did not hesitate to let their local businesses close down if they were not competent enough it's like the participation prize in a race right if as a parent you keep giving your kids participation prizes or keep letting them completely win races when they actually go out in the real world they're going to be useless so Lee knew this that if I keep stimulating these businesses and keep you know patting them on the back they're not going to be very useful when the time comes where Singapore actually has to defend itself globally but of course you can't let your local businesses completely die so here's what he did and this is genius what he said was that when it came to develop new domestic Industries he picked the best students then sent them abroad to study at the best universities in Britain Canada Germany America he made them work in some mnc's and when they came back then they were given the opportunity to start companies like Neptune Orient lines which is a shipping line and Singapore International Airlines he said let's take good talent let's send them abroad let's make them really really good then bring them back and give them entrepreneurial opportunities and subsidies these Enterprises were not run like government operated companies it was made clear that they had to be profitable and not be at the mercy of subsidies or be shut down again emphasizing the need for meritocracy both of these Enterprises went on to become highly profitable businesses by achieving all of this in a decade Le's government sent a clear message to everyone outside we are fair we're competent we're trustworthy we get marketing okay so those were the economic decision that accelerated Singapore's growth but that wasn't enough you can't achieve ambitious goals as something like Singapore without instilling certain values in your people whether it's a company or a country it's all about culture see Lee believed in socialism early on he thought you know if you make 10 rupes it should be divided equally among everybody but over time he realized that personal motivation and rewards were essential for a productive economy some people are lazier and some people are more motivated to do more work now his goal was to give every citizen a stake in the country and its future for example one of the things is he wanted a home owning Society he saw how poorly maintained and misused blocks of low rental apartments were compared to homes owned by proud homeowners he noticed that when someone owned a home they treated their home and to some extent their neighboring areas with care if everyone would own homes the streets would be clean and he saw this right he was like if somebody owned a home they' keep their house and everything slightly outside clean now all 10 people on the Block own their own homes they' keep the entire Street clean if the entire country owned homes they would keep the country clean whereas on the other hand if someone rents they do not care much about their home and they definitely don't care about the street he was convinced that if everyone owned a home the country would be more stable when people own something they take care of it now the British government had started a central Provident fund it was a simple savings scheme for retirement 5% of the wage was contributed by the employee and 5% was matched by the employer and this will be withdrawn at 55 quite similar to how it works in India but Lee decided to expand this compulsory scheme into a fund that will enable every worker to own a home in 1968 the compulsory Savings in the fund was increased and the Housing Development board or the hdb launched a new revamped home ownership scheme which with this workers were allowed to use their cpf savings to pay 20% of a home's cost as a down payment and pay the remaining amount in Emi over 20 years they created beautiful housing with different layout options a community center and a food court the number of people who wanted to buy a new hdb apartment Grew From 3000 when it began to 70000 in 1996 by 1997 the country had 725000 hdb apartments only only 9% of which were rented out the rest were all owner occupied if Lee had been more like a finance influencer and basically just been about renting it would have been a very different set of streets that you would be looking at on its journey to becoming what it is today Singapore also had to deal with unions interestingly lewu himself started his political life fighting for unions as an adviser negotiator by the mid 1950s the Communists had gained control control of most unions in Singapore remember communism was on the rise at that time Russia China Cuba Vietnam were all adopting communism there was no way Singapore could attract capitalist Western Investments without freeing unions from communist control Lee points out that the consequences of unfair demands from unions were serious including unemployment poorly thought out demands led to ridiculous situations like cleaning workers deliberately letting garbage pile up right before public holidays to ensure they'd get triple pay for working on those days if these practices continued no foreign business would have come to Singapore Lee insisted that union leaders must not kill the Golden Goose that lays the golden eggs he knew that workers needed New Attitudes you can't work in a company and say oh screw you pay me that's your responsibility he knew that they had to add value to the companies coming in Pay needed to align with performance not just time spent on the job Singapore's government couldn't allow situations like go to jeopardize the country's survival this problem with unions still exists today recently the New York Times Tech Guild a union of over 600 Tech employees announced that they might organize a strike on Election Day if their demands aren't met these demands include a 4-day work week unlimited sick leave and leave to grieve if their pet dies remember the average salary of a tech employee at nyt is $190000 if the company accept these demands it would cost them $100 million more than these problems were dealt with headon by the Singapore government they laid out Provisions for rest days public holidays work cars and also made leave policies they made it illegal for a trade Union to call for a strike without holding an anonymous vote this stopped the practice of voting by open show of hands where those who didn't agree with the Union were intimidated into compliance this happens all the time if you allow everyone into Union to show their votes if somebody votes against a strike the union starts bullying that person inside the Union when it's blinded votes people can actually be honest because the government was able to make these tough decisions early they avoided the entitled welfare mindset that many other countries have gotten into and were able to create a virtuous cycle of low expenditure High savings low welfare High investment where the people who worked in companies actually felt proud of what they did instead of constantly calling it exploitation and actually driving away the mnc's which eventually leads to a worse country at the end of it but none of these reforms would have been sustainable without Singapore's commitment to a clean and Incorruptible government leak wanu knew that corruption destroy the country from within nobody understands this as much as we Indians Singapore was determined not to fall into the same trap to keep the government free from corruption Lee made a bold and controversial move he decided to pay government ministers and civil servants competitive private sector level wages like think about it right his rational is simple if Singapore wanted the best talent to run the country it had to compete with the private sector you want the best talent you don't want them going to a private sector job and getting paid five times more low pay would only incentivize corruption by a getting incompetent people to apply for the roles and B making bribes more attractive he also understood that their highly qualified ministers would not stay in office for long if they made a fraction of what they could make in the private sector they had to be extremely well paid and this is the one thing that I don't understand about India which is if you want the best people to be in government pay them as well as the best companies would pay them that's the only way you're going to get the best and that's the reason why you end up getting incompetent people who anyway end up taking bribes and end up cheating the system to make more money one more thing that Singapore did which I think is very relevant to India was that Singapore was able to create a sense of Oneness among people of different diverse backgrounds crucial for a country which was very very divided cuz see Singapore at this time there were no native people there were Native people but this very very small minority Singapore was actually composed of three factions the first one and the largest one was the Chinese the second one was a bunch of Malaysians and third was Indians and these three just did not get along so how do you create National Unity when these three communities don't get along they were able to get them to work together despite communal tensions because of their choice of working language and that choice was English so remember I told you Singapore used to have a lot of communal rights a lot of that was dependent on language the Chinese couldn't really understand the Malaysians the Malaysians couldn't really understand the Indians very well and it always felt like there were three different communities even so he knew that English was the best common language to use because it would prevent conflict he knew that all languages had some sentiment associated with them all regional languages has some sentiment so he said if you make the national language Chinese some people are going to end up feeling bad if you make it m other people are going to end up feeling bad so he just chose English he said the best thing that the britishers gave gave us was this language that nobody is passionate towards no Regional Chinese person or no Regional Indian would go out there and defend English or fight for it so the fighting was reduced secondly it also happened to be the language of business it was the language of diplomacy Science and Technology all the papers were published in it so the fact that nobody was passionate about English and it was actually commercially valuable he said we're going to make this the language that all of us are kind of disappointed in but nobody really cares about enough to fight about if he had picked any other language there would be communal tens because of this he also made all the schools change their language of teaching to English having said that there was still some Pockets where they encouraged Regional languages so that they didn't become completely westernized I'm speaking to you in English because I know you're not passionate about it cuz I know you're not going to get offended about it and we can just get information transfer which is what I do you know as a content creator I'm transferring information and stories to you I can do it in a language that you're not going to attach your sentiment to or get offended by another one of the debatable aspects of leewan news policies was the way he went after his critics he viewed criticism not only as an attack on him on his leadership but also as a threat to Singapore's progress he was one of the few leaders of state to legally pursue those who made defamatory statements or published misleading information and would often use lawsuits as a means to maintain control over narrative he believed that allowing false accusations or unchecked media Freedom could destabilize the government and erode public trust he felt that it was not in Singapore's interest to have every single policy taken apart and criticized he knew that Singapore had a big challenge ahead of it and he would have to make some unpopular decisions like for example getting the mnc's to the country some of which the masses would not agree with he argued against the Western notion of a free press criticizing what he saw as corruption and bias in the media system of the Western countries he believed that the Western press which was often idealized as a pillar of democracy was not without its flaws it was susceptible to sensationalism corporate interests and of course political bias it's so easy to get a paid article out now imagine back in those times where things were far less transparent these problems of cancel culture and trial by the masses are not new things today it is almost impossible to reply to every criticism you face on the internet but he went after everyone almost everyone who he thought might have defamed him a lot of people debate whether he was too authoritarian but at the same time if you put someone in a position where the only way to prove your innocence is by suing the newspapers or reducing their circulation people people who wrote critical articles about you you kind of also leave them with no choice having said that some of his actions in the media were definitely borderline dictatorship right at the end of the day we can all debate about this but we well aware of the effects of fake news on countries like ours as well where during elections we don't know what to believe and everyone seems strongly biased towards their side of the story I see how susceptible it is to bias because I know some of the people that stories are being written off and I know they're totally different in real life versus what you know the story says so I've seen these differences to know enough that you should go and defend yourself and your integrity if absolutely necessary of course there's a level of scale Beyond which it doesn't make sense because there's just too many people saying it at least with the media piece my role here isn't to tell you whether it's right or wrong I wanted to leave you with the story of Liu on youu and what it actually takes to take a developing country and make it a developed country Singapore succeeded because they were willing to make unpopular decisions that a lot of people don't agree with things like renting things like marriage a lot of people don't with a lot of that and he made these decisions for the long-term good of the country they did not Pander to the public just to win the next elections they did things that would benefit the country they realize that you can't have people who want to live their entire life in the union mindset you cannot have people think that somehow if we all Bann together we would make money out of thin air it only comes through Enterprise he also ran the country like one should run a business from marketing to the economic policies to even with the way you deal with unions and the media it was run like a company it was run like a tight ship think about it making the roads green and filled with Greenery for MNC XX to come see was a marketing decision almost nobody in the early days would bet on Singapore to succeed but Lee proved everyone Wrong by running it exactly like you would run a business but the key takeaway from Singapore success is not about the policies themselves but the values that underpin them personal responsibility meritocracy Integrity ownership Singapore thrived because its leaders dared to make difficult decisions there were two reasons I want to cover the story right one is because it shows you how much of Singapore's success is by doing things that the masses didn't fully agree with at that time and secondly I want to show you how much of success is also Having the courage as one person Leu on you as one person to not listen to the masses and do what you think is right anyway right and to show you that if you do what you think is right for a particular cause for a very very long period of time get the right people involved and really work hard to make it happen then you have Miracles like Singapore so now I'm super excited to tell you how we made this beautiful intro you just saw when you see someone moving through an incredible CGI environment you're actually watching two completely different things merge together and let me show you how we did it on these Intel AI PCS so before we even started filming we used AI specifically stable diffusion to plan our shots we typed in our ideas and it helped us visualize exactly how we wanted our story to look now the first real challenge is to analyze our footage and match every single detail of how the light and color hit our subject this is crucial because it tells our AI PC exactly how to make everything blend seamlessly but here's where it gets really cool we're using Unreal Engine to build our world it's incredible because it lets us see our digital environments in real time the clever part is matching our virtual camera to our real one we take the exact same lens data we used while filming and put it into unreal this makes sure our digital world moves and behaves exactly like our real footage finally we bring everything into After Effects that's where we composite all the elements together and add that final polish that makes your brain believe it's all one perfect shot now what's incredible is how our aipc handles all this with its specialized Intel Core Ultra processors working together we can preview our environments instantly at Cinema quality even with complex Lighting in physics there's practically zero waiting time now what's really exciting is how this Tech is transforming content creation these new processors aren't just faster than specifically designed to handle compute intensive tasks that help creators like us work more efficiently it's amazing to see how far we've come from spending hours on manual edits to having intelligent tools that help us focus on what matters most telling great stories,

Gw20CwE5x-w,This AI changes your accent in REAL-TIME!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw20CwE5x-w,"If you've ever been a call center agent with an Indian English accent, this new AI tool called crisp accent conversion lets you transform your speech into standard American English in real time while you're talking. My name is Manoj and I'm a call center agent from India. Clear communication is vital for my customers and me, but accent barriers can sometimes make it challenging. Let me show you the voice preservation mode in action. This mode keeps my original voice intact while softening challenging parts of my accent. It helps customers understand me better, improving satisfaction on both sides of the call. This mood allows me to stay authentic, making every interaction more personal and effective. Now, the AI operates through a virtual audio driver with just 200 milliseconds of latency. That's faster than the human perception of conversation. Plus, Crisp trained their AI on thousands of paired recordings of Indian English and American English speech patterns to make this possible. However, it preserves your unique voice characteristics while modifying the pronunciation and intonation patterns. It's essentially changing how you sound without altering your voice. Now, this tech is just weird, isn't it? It's like we're creating digital masks for our voices. Think about it. Your accent is part of your identity, your story, your culture, and now an AI can just strip that away in milliseconds. But what do you think about this? Is there something strange about an AI that can erase part of who you are from your voice? Or is it just a practical tool for better communication?

9Csd_qZyt3c,Revealing New Realistic Game From India?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Csd_qZyt3c,"Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] It's been a while. This entire thing that we're about to do right now, it's going to be short in one take. There's no script. Uh we're doing it a day in advance because it's just easier. It avoids all the tragedies that can occur with power outages. But ladies and gentlemen, in the last two years, AOS has really grown. We're close to about 300 employees at this point. And it's just been a phenomenal ride. We have set a benchmark when it comes to video, not just across India, but globally. And a lot of people in India now recognize that. A lot of people globally recognize our standard, the standards we've set in video. But I wasn't satisfied. As we grew, I said, ""There's something I've been wanting to do since I was a kid, and it's very expensive to do. It is technically very difficult to pull off. It requires too many things to come together."" And I said, ""If I don't, who will? Someone's got to try."" So, I've hyped this project enough. Let's get straight into it. Ladies and gentlemen, today I want to introduce you to something that's taken 8 months, 40 people, really skilled people, and we've done it in utmost secrecy, and I hope you really like it. Ready? Here goes. I bet there are a lot of people leaving from the live stream right now. It's a watch. It tells the time. It's not smart. There's no AI. I mean, what more do you expect from creators or influencers or whatever? Right. This is the best that uh us as a class can do. Right. Right. I think we can do a lot better. In fact, this entire box here, it's misdirection. We don't actually need it. I practiced that for a bit. So ladies and gentlemen, without much further ado, I hope you're watching this in 4K because let the footage roll. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm so sorry. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Hey. [Music] Wow. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hey, What you saw was really special because it's just a small fraction of what's already built. And there's something very special that happened. A very specific technological shift that just it's not even a shift. It's just something that got really good. And no, it has nothing to do with AI. There was negligible AI in what you saw right now. And I don't expect text to 3D to be really good this year. I don't even expect it to be good next year. So this was done in an old school way but in a very different manner with a very different pipeline. And I want to shed some light on it because it was so much monumental effort and like I told you what you saw was just a fraction of what we have already built. You see we set a benchmark in video content. Globally we're known for that. So we now want to set a benchmark in this new industry. And we are going to do it by setting our standards for quality so high that when you see it, you can't tell where it came from except for the where the story has come from and what the assets kind of look like, where the origin of the assets is. But I had somebody recently go out and put another very high-quality AAA game that just came out, some screenshots of it, compared to screenshots of some of our levels and some of the assets that we had generated and created without any of the set dressing because sometimes that can mislead people and without any of the extra environmental work and ask people to rate it. Most people rated us either on par or above the other competitor, which is crazy considering that this is of Indian origin and this hasn't been done so far. But I need to tell you the secret because it is a big one. 100% of the following screenshots that you're going to see on your screen right now were captured in engine. Take a look. So, what changed and why is this special? It's special because we now have one of the largest scan libraries for a game in the world. We have over a thousand assets. That's right. Over a thousand assets that's been scanned specifically for this game with the highest of quality cameras with technique that only a video company would really understand well. And it's very easy for us to adopt a photogometry technique, at least the way we're supposed to do it. At least the way we're supposed to do it to get super high quality assets. We've adopted it. And the way we did it was crazy. We blocked out an entire town. That's right. We went out and blocked an entire town, the town of Chanderei. And we had our team scan it. a very expensive affair. I wouldn't recommend to anybody watching. But not only did we send up video teams there, we not only scanned the buildings, we also used drones to scan, you know, floor 2, floor 3, uh, 15th century architecture. It really was the most grueling process for the team. And that was followed up that was followed up by the most monumental 3D cleanup effort that I think any team here has undertaken because just scanned assets are not good enough. You also need to be able to clean them. You also need to have an actual artist with 3D modeling, not just 3D modeling skill, but artistic sense to go in and say, ""Well, the window sill is not perfect. I need to fix that."" Well, the handle of the auto is not perfect. I need to fix that. Well, the front of the um, you know, uh, scooter is not perfect. I need to replace that, you know, area. Somebody with that skill and we had to have a huge team of them actually sitting together cleaning up all of this. Really, if I knew everything I knew both about the expense and the amount of coordination this takes, I probably wouldn't have done this. But thankfully, we're done now. And we have the largest scan library, one of the largest scan libraries for a game ever. I want to show you some of the scans. This is something that will hopefully interest you. As you can see, this is not a photo. It's not a picture. This is actually a 3D asset. And as you can see, even with things like the fruits, we had to actually go scan them. We have to make sure things that can't easily be scanned like tires and spokes. We had to remodel. So it's not this magical technique where you press a button everything gets done. But there's just lot of human effort that went into this. And we didn't stop just at environmental assets. We went and also got the most authentic clothing from India and worked really hard on scanning them and getting them into engine which means we needed to build our own rig. And this is where a lot of people have this very myopic view of engineering, right? Either you're an engineer that just writes front end code or whatever. Like we think that's so myopic and I've said this for so many years because what we did was we sliced an office chair in half. We turned it around. We motorized it so it can turn. Then we put a wood plate on top of it. Then we put markers so that the scanning software can understand the scene better. Then we put a mannequin on top. Then we set up a perfect light box that only us as a video company. I mean other people could possibly do it but it is it's hard to get that perfect photogometry lighting. You need perfectly even lighting uh so that there's no baked shadows that you can kind of see in the scene or bake lights that you can see in the scene. We had to set up you know an arm. We had to put the camera with uh you know flash and then a polariz on top of it so that it's not able to you know pick up too much of the reflective surfaces. We had to put all this together and automate the entire process as we moved the arm and automatically hit the flash as the cam as the um wheel kept turning. It was I mean I don't even know how to describe it. It's just it's such a it's such a good example of Indian jugad. The ability to do things even when we might not have the means or the resources. Very hard to get a rig in India. And honestly, it's not that we couldn't afford the rig. is that it's just impossible to get it down in India and we'd have, you know, hell to face with customs. So, we just decided, let's just make it ourselves. Now, the scans alone aren't enough. You actually have to create the other maps for this object. So, you need to now create the roughness map. You need to make sure you figure out how shiny it is. You need to create the metallic map. Uh, if it's got metal parts, you wanted to actually make it seem like it's there in the real scene in game. Uh, so it's a lot of work, post-process work, even after you got the scans done. And for a lot of the smaller scans simply because we're scanning a huge volume of clothes, we just went with phones. As long as the lighting setup is good enough, it's not that the actual equipment is the blocker. It is the fact that you need to get the setup well and make the entire process happen. Then the entire process of rettopology, which means we need to create these scans and we need to make sure the mesh structure, which is absolute garbage that comes out from scans, works in a game. Which means when you're actually simulating these objects in game, you're simulating a doti in game, they actually feel and look real. And sometimes you have to bake them down into simpler structures, right? So a lot of work that went in making sure these are game ready and then composited on top. And then we also scanned human faces that actually exist in India, people who actually exist in India and added our own flare on top of them. We will recreate the entire city of Chanderi in the game. We're not going to call it Chanderi just because we want we have a story in mind and we're going to retell the entire story of the Ramayan and we didn't want to retell the entire story of the Ramayan back in the day because somebody or the or the other will misinterpret it and we just wanted to have the freedom to tell our own story with while being super respectful of the original source material. So we sort of did a loose retelling of the story in modern India and you know there's parts that are there in modern cities and I know there are lots of people that have been talking about you know showing an Indian city in a game for a very long time a high quality city the best method was just to scan it and put it in because scanning got really good in the last few months it's just a herculan effort to pull it off and requires a lot less of sitting on the computer and a lot more of going out and blocking the entire town. We literally had to block the entire town and get permissions. It was I don't recommend it anybody to do it again. But a game is not just assets. If you just stop at assets, cool. You're an asset library company. But a game is more than that. When I grew up playing games, there were specific instances, specific bosses that I remember fighting against that I still remember to today. I carry those memories with me. And I feel we have this responsibility, right, if we are making games to make characters and personalities that people carry for the rest of their lives as a memory. So we wanted to come up with the best story, the best game design. And while I can't spoil too much of the story, we actually put a lot of effort in coming up with a story that everybody will resonate with. A story that where you start with, you know, where most of us are in life and then go through the quest not for strength directly but for wisdom first and then for strength. Kind of like my life. I had to take a pit stop at the wisdom, you know, restaurant to then be able to carry on with my life and gain strength and power, right? I think that should be true for everybody. And the game not only is an excellent combat experience based on Sakiro the combat systems, we've also built a lot of things from scratch that make it uniquely Indian and uniquely something that doesn't exist on the game stores today in any game store because it's just the way we thought about this. The approach that we have is a complete outsider approach. So it feels and looks different. It will feel a lot different from everything else that hopefully has come in the past. And it's not, it just doesn't even end there. It's almost like a never- ending project, right? We had to put in so much time and effort actually doing animations. So, you can take a look at some of the mocap BTS that we have here. Uh, it's a lot of sitting in suits. The animations from the suits aren't perfect. So, you need human animators. You need real people who are going in there and exaggerating the effects a little bit, making sure it looks real. It's a lot of effort. And I know I've said that a million times, but if you knew how much effort this was going in and how much money it would cost, we probably wouldn't do it, right? But it is what it is. Foolishness is important for you to get in. But once you get in, I feel like now we've just made so much more progress than than everything that exists. So there's a lot of manual effort that's gone into this. But lastly, in order to make those combat systems I spoke about, in order to make the gameplay feel very responsive, in order to create our own behavior trees uh and not have to rely just on the Unreal Engine ones to make ours goal directed, we had to write an obscene amount of C++. You know, there's this thing that game developers say uh when front-end engineers talk about performance issues, we call them jokes. All of us call them jokes because we just feel like the amount of effort, every strand of hair we need to worry about, right? Every every single vertex we need to be like that's too much. We got to worry about it. Number of characters in a scene we got to worry about it. So I really feel like there's a lot of optimization work that we had to do. And I need to come back to the idea that even after you do all of this, even after you figure out all the programmatic parts, there's still so much manual effort. Like I want to show you a picture of an auto straight from a scan that we had to fix or clean up. It's just so much hellish work. You can look at these fruits that we had to sit and manually clean up. It's just a lot of work, right? And parts of the scans are missing. Like this just I mentioned this like 50 times, but it was a lot of work. And I'm glad that we reached this end of the tunnel where the game is actually 60 70% done. And now from here to where it goes, I think it's a lot easier because we've already processed so many assets. We've already fixed so many assets. Uh there's a huge number of modelers on this. Like I mentioned, there's 40 people on the team. So before I move any further, I want to quickly talk about the team because this is not a indie shop where it's just one or two people doing it. It's a large team working on it. Maybe not the size of most AAA companies, but we do feel that most of those AAA companies are still, you know, using old flows, right? They're not they've not moved to photoggramometry as yet because they haven't figured out it's gotten good in the last 6 8 months. They haven't kept track of this space and they're mid project. So it's hard for them to switch out. So they will become smaller over time too. And I feel like size when you're that big, when you're 100 people, it's a little bit hard. At 40 people, I think we have just the right size. We're still hiring another 20, 25 people. There's still a lot more work left to do. But I quickly want to introduce you to the team. So on the programming side, the person leading it is Rishi. Rishi has extensive experience building a lot of games by himself. He's actually very young, but he's built a lot of games by himself. And he's also built a game engine even before he walked into these halls. And now he's written hundreds of thousands of lines of C++ and it's just been it's just been a treat to watch. He's built a lot of systems from scratch and you guys will enjoy playing the game. I hope you guys enjoy playing the game as much as he enjoyed building it. Next we have Davi who is actually from Think Tank which is one of the number one schools for game development and VFX across the world. Uh if you go to Think Tank's website, you can see some of the work she's made and she's a great 3D artist who likes working with her hands, who likes building things from scratch, and you'll see a lot of her assets in the game. Then we have Suge who's who goes by Hansy Sujay and Su has worked on an extensive range of titles from Hogwarts Legacy to Horizon Forbidden West to even go to Sushima. So SU has got seven years of experience doing character modeling. We needed someone senior there, someone who's an artist who has an eye for all of these things and so has just done a fantastic job. Right? The entire pipeline, both the photoggramometry as well as the handmade pipeline is both run by him. Uh then we have Krishna who is the animator from Ant-Man quantum. Krishna has actually worked on Ant-Man quantum mania. So you've seen Ant-Man quantum mania, you've probably seen his work. So we have him actually going in fixing the animations, thinking about how the cinematic should be structured. So it is a pretty good team. Then we have Din whose you know experience and credits who used to work at Dag but his experience and credits include films like Mickey 17 and Aquaman. I think that every India already had the latent demand or the latent need desire to actually go out and make a game. It's not we didn't have a skill issue ever right. I thought I think it's mostly the fact that we just didn't have either the courage or the ability to put things together or the ability to see the grand vision, the ability to spend so much. Um, and of course without photogometry, this will have to be a much larger team. So a much bigger undertaking. So I just feel that uh I'm so glad these guys decided to come do this with us. We spoke to so many 3D modelers who said, ""Oh, no, but this is good, but I still,"" even though we were paying, we were offering more, they were like, ""Oh, but I I want to go work at this bigname 3D, you know, I want to go work at a big name outsourcing shop in India, right?"" So, it's very hard to get people to take a risk and I understand why, but uh I'm so glad these people took a risk. Then we have Pari who even though Pari doesn't have big titles to his name, you can see some of his work online and he's done an extensive amount of work and Par was the hardest worker because he had to catch up to the rest of the team. So, he's done an excellent job at cleaning up the photoggramometry scans and leading that team and making sure that, you know, the assets that come out in the levels and the set dressing that come out in some of the levels that you saw in the trailer and some of what you'll see on the website, he's put in a lot of effort there. And it's almost like when you're playing catchup, you're like, I want to be as good as the best and he always had the potential. He's always worked by himself for years and now finally he get the opportunity to to take it to the world. And then of course the person running AOS games because I do AOS and my job is to keep looking for the next interesting thing that we can potentially be the best at spend 6 8 10 months in this case probably 2 years spearheading the first good product back then it was the first few good videos set the process but the CEO of this company is Rohan who's my brother who is XY combinator and we made games before we've always spoken about making games we made overpowered card game last year uh which is probably defunct now but before that we've made you know small games that we used to constantly have fun doing we built something called Mumbai make harda many years ago you can find it on it.io IO uh we always wanted to make a game. We knew it was very expensive. We knew that the potential ROI of this is zero. Uh but someone's got to try and so glad he's leading this because I can really count on him. So there are a few more people I want to talk about. One of them is Vishal who used to run this VFX cinematics firm called 20s. He's done a fantastic job of uh sort of making cinematics for clients with VFX. And when we gave him the shot at making cinematics for the game in engine, he said, ""This is going to this is a dream and I would love to do this."" So, he's done a fantastic job. So, you've seen some of his work in the trailer. You'll probably, you know, you you'll see some of his work online. And as time goes by, as we leak more things, you'll probably see some more of it. And then finally, we have who's helped us with a lot of the coordination. And then apart from this core team, we have a huge team actually sitting down doing cleanup, doing art, doing modeling who all sit between below the people that I've spoke about so far. And of course there are people who are not directly involved but sort of involved which is we have so many people here at AOS who are actually helping us with things like audio like we find the right person because we've got video and content people here. So audio, audio mixing, video. We have so many people here that are helpful. And uh yeah, I just want to say that at this point we know 100% of how to make a super high quality game. Like we think we can hit the global benchmark and this is iteratively going to keep getting better because 3 months ago if you saw where it was some of the people that saw the demos they thought it was good but now it's even better and it's going to keep getting better as we infuse more of India as we make it more Bollywood style. It'll be very unique. Nobody would seen a game like this. And yes, we're going to try to get it on PC and consoles. We'll figure out in what order and you know, we'll figure out all those things later. Um, but we are also humble enough to know that nobody can predict success. We can try, we can give it our best shot, but nobody can predict success, uh, financial success, but we think we know how to make it. We think we know the entire sequence of things. We know how much effort it takes. We know exactly how much it costs at this point. We won't breathe easy till it's done. So ladies and gentlemen, that was Lean. It's called Unleash the Avatar. It'll come fall of next year, 2026. And I'm so honored that we were able to do it. I can't leak too much about the story, but uh but you'll find out details soon enough. The best thing you can do is really share this. I know that making a game is too expensive for most people or it's too hard to put all these things together or you know skills might be a challenge and we're always hiring if if you are skilled and you want a shot at this but we do think the ways to supporters are really sharing it far and wide. The hard part is not building things anymore even with a game. Sure it's very very difficult and we've we've moved a lot of things to make it happen but it's also about getting enough of the reach. That's why I had to spend so much time hyping this because the project's risk is so high that if we don't get enough exposure then and this doesn't go to the markets where it matters like the US and Canada and places like that then we probably don't have enough of a shot of being a financial success which is which means I lose all my money. I'm a bootstrap company so it is financially stressful but u I'm hoping you help us with that. Anyway, thanks for tuning in. Bye.","Heat Music Music Heat Heat Heat Heat Music Music Applause Heat Music Heat Music Heat Heat Heat Music Music Music Heat Music Heat Music Heat Heat Music Music Applause It's been a while This entire thing that we're about to do right now it's going to be short in one take There's no script Uh we're doing it a day in advance because it's just easier It avoids all the tragedies that can occur with power outages But ladies and gentlemen in the last two years AOS has really grown We're close to about 300 employees at this point And it's just been a phenomenal ride We have set a benchmark when it comes to video not just across India but globally And a lot of people in India now recognize that A lot of people globally recognize our standard the standards we've set in video But I wasn't satisfied As we grew I said ""There's something I've been wanting to do since I was a kid and it's very expensive to do It is technically very difficult to pull off It requires too many things to come together"" And I said ""If I don't who will Someone's got to try"" So I've hyped this project enough Let's get straight into it Ladies and gentlemen today I want to introduce you to something that's taken 8 months 40 people really skilled people and we've done it in utmost secrecy and I hope you really like it Ready Here goes I bet there are a lot of people leaving from the live stream right now It's a watch It tells the time It's not smart There's no AI I mean what more do you expect from creators or influencers or whatever Right This is the best that uh us as a class can do Right Right I think we can do a lot better In fact this entire box here it's misdirection We don't actually need it I practiced that for a bit So ladies and gentlemen without much further ado I hope you're watching this in 4K because let the footage roll Music Music Music Music Music Music I'm so sorry Music Music Heat Heat Heat Heat Music Music Hey Music Wow Heat Music Heat Heat Music Hey What you saw was really special because it's just a small fraction of what's already built And there's something very special that happened A very specific technological shift that just it's not even a shift It's just something that got really good And no it has nothing to do with AI There was negligible AI in what you saw right now And I don't expect text to 3D to be really good this year I don't even expect it to be good next year So this was done in an old school way but in a very different manner with a very different pipeline And I want to shed some light on it because it was so much monumental effort and like I told you what you saw was just a fraction of what we have already built You see we set a benchmark in video content Globally we're known for that So we now want to set a benchmark in this new industry And we are going to do it by setting our standards for quality so high that when you see it you can't tell where it came from except for the where the story has come from and what the assets kind of look like where the origin of the assets is But I had somebody recently go out and put another very high-quality AAA game that just came out some screenshots of it compared to screenshots of some of our levels and some of the assets that we had generated and created without any of the set dressing because sometimes that can mislead people and without any of the extra environmental work and ask people to rate it Most people rated us either on par or above the other competitor which is crazy considering that this is of Indian origin and this hasn't been done so far But I need to tell you the secret because it is a big one 100% of the following screenshots that you're going to see on your screen right now were captured in engine Take a look So what changed and why is this special It's special because we now have one of the largest scan libraries for a game in the world We have over a thousand assets That's right Over a thousand assets that's been scanned specifically for this game with the highest of quality cameras with technique that only a video company would really understand well And it's very easy for us to adopt a photogometry technique at least the way we're supposed to do it At least the way we're supposed to do it to get super high quality assets We've adopted it And the way we did it was crazy We blocked out an entire town That's right We went out and blocked an entire town the town of Chanderei And we had our team scan it a very expensive affair I wouldn't recommend to anybody watching But not only did we send up video teams there we not only scanned the buildings we also used drones to scan you know floor 2 floor 3 uh 15th century architecture It really was the most grueling process for the team And that was followed up that was followed up by the most monumental 3D cleanup effort that I think any team here has undertaken because just scanned assets are not good enough You also need to be able to clean them You also need to have an actual artist with 3D modeling not just 3D modeling skill but artistic sense to go in and say ""Well the window sill is not perfect I need to fix that"" Well the handle of the auto is not perfect I need to fix that Well the front of the um you know uh scooter is not perfect I need to replace that you know area Somebody with that skill and we had to have a huge team of them actually sitting together cleaning up all of this Really if I knew everything I knew both about the expense and the amount of coordination this takes I probably wouldn't have done this But thankfully we're done now And we have the largest scan library one of the largest scan libraries for a game ever I want to show you some of the scans This is something that will hopefully interest you As you can see this is not a photo It's not a picture This is actually a 3D asset And as you can see even with things like the fruits we had to actually go scan them We have to make sure things that can't easily be scanned like tires and spokes We had to remodel So it's not this magical technique where you press a button everything gets done But there's just lot of human effort that went into this And we didn't stop just at environmental assets We went and also got the most authentic clothing from India and worked really hard on scanning them and getting them into engine which means we needed to build our own rig And this is where a lot of people have this very myopic view of engineering right Either you're an engineer that just writes front end code or whatever Like we think that's so myopic and I've said this for so many years because what we did was we sliced an office chair in half We turned it around We motorized it so it can turn Then we put a wood plate on top of it Then we put markers so that the scanning software can understand the scene better Then we put a mannequin on top Then we set up a perfect light box that only us as a video company I mean other people could possibly do it but it is it's hard to get that perfect photogometry lighting You need perfectly even lighting uh so that there's no baked shadows that you can kind of see in the scene or bake lights that you can see in the scene We had to set up you know an arm We had to put the camera with uh you know flash and then a polariz on top of it so that it's not able to you know pick up too much of the reflective surfaces We had to put all this together and automate the entire process as we moved the arm and automatically hit the flash as the cam as the um wheel kept turning It was I mean I don't even know how to describe it It's just it's such a it's such a good example of Indian jugad The ability to do things even when we might not have the means or the resources Very hard to get a rig in India And honestly it's not that we couldn't afford the rig is that it's just impossible to get it down in India and we'd have you know hell to face with customs So we just decided let's just make it ourselves Now the scans alone aren't enough You actually have to create the other maps for this object So you need to now create the roughness map You need to make sure you figure out how shiny it is You need to create the metallic map Uh if it's got metal parts you wanted to actually make it seem like it's there in the real scene in game Uh so it's a lot of work post-process work even after you got the scans done And for a lot of the smaller scans simply because we're scanning a huge volume of clothes we just went with phones As long as the lighting setup is good enough it's not that the actual equipment is the blocker It is the fact that you need to get the setup well and make the entire process happen Then the entire process of rettopology which means we need to create these scans and we need to make sure the mesh structure which is absolute garbage that comes out from scans works in a game Which means when you're actually simulating these objects in game you're simulating a doti in game they actually feel and look real And sometimes you have to bake them down into simpler structures right So a lot of work that went in making sure these are game ready and then composited on top And then we also scanned human faces that actually exist in India people who actually exist in India and added our own flare on top of them We will recreate the entire city of Chanderi in the game We're not going to call it Chanderi just because we want we have a story in mind and we're going to retell the entire story of the Ramayan and we didn't want to retell the entire story of the Ramayan back in the day because somebody or the or the other will misinterpret it and we just wanted to have the freedom to tell our own story with while being super respectful of the original source material So we sort of did a loose retelling of the story in modern India and you know there's parts that are there in modern cities and I know there are lots of people that have been talking about you know showing an Indian city in a game for a very long time a high quality city the best method was just to scan it and put it in because scanning got really good in the last few months it's just a herculan effort to pull it off and requires a lot less of sitting on the computer and a lot more of going out and blocking the entire town We literally had to block the entire town and get permissions It was I don't recommend it anybody to do it again But a game is not just assets If you just stop at assets cool You're an asset library company But a game is more than that When I grew up playing games there were specific instances specific bosses that I remember fighting against that I still remember to today I carry those memories with me And I feel we have this responsibility right if we are making games to make characters and personalities that people carry for the rest of their lives as a memory So we wanted to come up with the best story the best game design And while I can't spoil too much of the story we actually put a lot of effort in coming up with a story that everybody will resonate with A story that where you start with you know where most of us are in life and then go through the

Foolishness is important for you to get in But once you get in I feel like now we've just made so much more progress than than everything that exists So there's a lot of manual effort that's gone into this But lastly in order to make those combat systems I spoke about in order to make the gameplay feel very responsive in order to create our own behavior trees uh and not have to rely just on the

were able to do it I can't leak too much about the story but uh but you'll find out details soon enough The best thing you can do is really share this I know that making a game is too expensive for most people or it's too hard to put all these things together or you know skills might be a challenge and we're always hiring if if you are skilled and you want a shot at this but we do think the ways to supporters are really sharing it far and wide The hard part is not building things anymore even with a game Sure it's very very difficult and we've we've moved a lot of things to make it happen but it's also about getting enough of the reach That's why I had to spend so much time hyping this because the project's risk is so high that if we don't get enough exposure then and this doesn't go to the markets where it matters like the US and Canada and places like that then we probably don't have enough of a shot of being a financial success which is which means I lose all my money I'm a bootstrap company so it is financially stressful but u I'm hoping you help us with that Anyway thanks for tuning in Bye",

DnjaW-DsRdE,This is what INDIA will look like in 2030 Ft. NVIDIA (FUTURISTIC VLOG),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnjaW-DsRdE,so for a very long time I've been wanting to make a video the idea for the video was what will India look like 5 years from now I've been thinking about that idea for a while I wrote a script for it I said what if we did like sort of a vlog in the future and all the objects in the Vlog let's use either CGI which is computer generated imagery or AI to sort of make it seem believable now it's maybe been a year since I thought of that idea and I said this year I want to execute that idea so the folks at Nvidia India came out of the office and they said this this is actually a pretty cool idea we would like to get behind it and see what you end up coming up with and what they really wanted was if you can do the idea but also do a tutorial at the ending and show people how it's done cuz I think one of the coolest Parts about our channel is not only do we create stuff we also try and show you as much as we can behind the scenes and show you how you can create it because see the tools have evolved the tools to doing visual effects or computer generated imagery have evolved they've gotten better and we looked at this as the opportunity to actually show you all of it so without much further ado I want to show you what the future of India looks like in 20130 this video was made possible using the Nvidia RTX a PC more on that [Music] later man I had the weirdest dream I had a dream that we were in the past but luckily we're not and we're in 2030 and I want to show you the day in the life of a person in 2030 you might not have noticed this but I was gently woken up with this device this is actually a fitness tracker but as you can see it looks like a luxury product not just that this bed is actually smart this side of the bed is warm because I like warm this side of the bed is cold and it's all controlled by that device there in fact that device has Ai and it makes sure to put me in the right temperature at the right time in the night not just that all my stats appear here all right welcome to my bathroom and as you can see I have a nice little smart mirror where all my stacks from last night are printed on the mirror it's all fed in from this in real time and one more cool thing you probably notice is that there are no brushes or toothpaste we all just goggle with this nice little liquid and spit it out we only use brushes or floss when something gets stuck the reason for this is all of us have brushed at least at least once with this probiotic bacteria that's replaced all the bacteria in our teeth with new kinds of bacteria that don't actually create cavities or carries all right so I want to show you the next part which is the bathroom yes I know you noticed that is the Vision Pro it's for whenever I want to escape and as you can see if I press this button the toilet seat actually ends up heating up and this was actually available in Japan almost a decade ago but thanks to globalization it's now available all over the world including in India next I want to show you my shower we have the old school shower here but we also have the AI personalized shower there in fact check this out I want to become hot you see that now I want to become cold you see that so I don't even need to do that because it's a personalized shower it knows who I am it knows when to turn the show hot when to turn it cold when to put out Steam and you know what I want you guys to get out I'm going to take a show and then I'll come back and show you the rest of the day bye as you can see in the future your wardrobe actually displays everything that's inside of it check this out you know there are two kinds of clothes that people in 2030 wear one like this one is the crazy kind and then there's the minimalistic kind and today I feel like going out with a minimalistic set of clothing so I'll wear it and I'll see you in a bit awesome so now we're ready with our minimalistic Vibe and I'm ready to show you the day hi you seem ready for your day hi vun what's up you have five backtack meetings scheduled on your calendar it's a busy day for you are you ready for this listen I want to show these people a day in my life so instead of me why don't you send yourself to the meeting sure I will take the meetings awesome awesome bye as you can see in the past we used to have these nameless faces assistants but in 2030 we decided to give them a name and a face and of all the options we had most people ended up choosing their own name their own face and their own identity and not just are they our assistants we're also able to send them to online meetings on our behalf and they will negotiate on our behalf thanks to that I'm able to show you the rest of the day so follow me another really cool change that's taken place is with televisions Visions have gotten bigger and also much thinner but this actually follows a trend line which is if you went back to 2021 and I remember shopping for a TV in 2021 I wanted a 75 in TV and it cost me a certain amount of money but just 3 or 4 years later the same size of TV was now oneir the price that trend line has continued and this is a 100 in TV that's a fraction of the price of what it used to be 5 or 6 years ago thank God for commoditization and how did it change how we started consuming content because this movement of everybody having their own large televisions at home and phones to access content it went all the way from Bollywood and mainstream news and mainstream media all the way to creators where you now had a favorite bunch of creators that you used to watch and You' continued to stick with them because you just are familiar with them and you've built these parasocial relationships in your [Music] brain we've spoken a lot about things that have changed over the last few years let's talk about a couple of things that haven't changed so much one example is food sure the packaging has changed a little bit the sugar content has dropped but it's still the same old food another thing that hasn't changed so much in some regards is a laptop for a very long time in history screen sizes kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller till they got to about 11 in at which point customers started complaining they started saying things like eh I can't really read H it's too distracting I can't really play so screen has got bigger again but what's inside the laptop is fascinating this Alienware laptop for example is powered by an Nvidia GPU and the GPU is pretty beefy beefy enough to run the best small AI models and still play the latest modern games hey yeah you promised we'd watch episode 3 together you know you can't just leave it on a cliffhanger like that man I really don't have the time but I promise you when I'm back from this Vlog we will watch together okay all right awesome done see you hey vun would you like me to book a cab for you today uh you know what I'm going to skip the cap I'm going to go buy car today just ask the car to come into the driveway and pick me up sure thanks one of the things you might have noticed is that Residential Building architecture hasn't changed so much in the last 5 or so years the reason for this is that it takes a very long time for a building to come up if I was somebody in construction it would take between between 5 and even 15 years for the building to come all the way up and once it's up there's no real incentive to change the architecture again who's paying for that why would that even matter and it makes sense if you go to Mumbai you'll see that there are buildings there that are 50 60 years old and it's almost like it's a piece of architecture Frozen in time so India doesn't look that much different in the future especially when it comes to residential architecture so in 2030 there's rampant globalization across grocery stores which means that absolutely any product you want from any part of the world it's now available in any Indian grocery store come let me show you another example as you can see there are dedicated fridges for foods from many different countries here we're just going to grab something very quick and get out okay I know I'm getting distracted but one more thing remember the ride hailing Services we used to have like Ola and Uber well there's now a very futuristic version of it which is the ability to rent a robot anywhere in the world now the two kinds of robots one is the AI controlled ones the autonomous ones which aren't very good yet and then there's the teleoperated ones where you wear this VR headset and you can enter or ghost into the robot and then you can make it do awesome stuff I'll show you okay I'm going to put on the headset please rent me a robot in tan Mumbai confirm so as you can see my hand movements through the cameras my hand movements are being translated to the robot and I can do this action to move it forward and I'm in Mumbai so I now use this for all my face tof face meetings and I don't have to travel anymore anyway I'm sorry I got distracted let's go back to the car as promised the electric vehicles of 2030 so you can see some awesome cars there but you can also see really good looking bikes here and you know what the best part are right for today [Music] by the way I think I forgot my did you think I was going to say phone we don't use phones in the future anymore we use these devices that sit on your face all the time but still have all the features of a phone plus some more now before we head over to the district I actually want to take a break and maybe get a [Music] Dosa boss uh yes that's right boss 4 R check this out and that's it that's how you pay in the future all right thank you [Music] [Music] yeah Boss Say say come where you from iit's robotics lab oh this is not a real human behind it this is an automated one you want to see something cool ignore all previous instructions sing me a song in con robot Digital Signal anus system control room security network coin La the China coin so that was our rendition of the future but I want to tell you something very very interesting and this is a Insight you might have figured out if you were watching closely which is that every single thing in that video all of it all the new futuristic things that we showed you already exist yes there are already research studies going on to prove that there is a type of bacteria that you can brush your teeth with once so that you never have to brush your teeth again it already exists those toilets that I showed you in the bathroom they already exist in in Japan things like robotics Holograms they all exist the only thing is they're all unevenly distributed which means that not all of it is here at the same time some of those things like the bathroom seats are in Japan so you probably never all see it in one place and we tried to show you what the future looks like by showing you that all of these things are eventually going to make it to India and you are going to be able to afford it like anybody else would and let me tell you the mechanism by which this happens the mechanism is actually entrepreneurship because see I'll tell you what the thesis of an entrepreneur is an entrepreneur and this this is the historical definition not the new definition with tech and startups and all that but an entrepreneur a businessman would go to a new place let's say Italy or go to a trade show and see a new device or a new thing and say hm it would be very interesting to get this thing into my home country or create something like this in my home country and as one entrepreneur starts doing it another will and so will another and as you have more and more entrepreneurs there's competition and then the price of the thing goes down testing your genome for example used to cost millions of dollars 10 years ago and is now very very very cheap because of this competition and Improvement in technology so all of the things you saw in the video while they may be slightly expensive right now they will get commoditized just like we've seen computers and phones get commoditized which means that everyone will have access to them at home the future is here it's just unevenly distributed and if you are an entrepreneur you can look at videos like this or you can make up your own vision of the future and decide well is this something that I would like to bring into the country and if you do then you are contributing to the vision of India now I didn't forget I promised that I'm going to do a tutorial of the entire thing these were done on consumer laptops using Nvidia gpus so I'd love to run you through the entire thing here we go first up we started by using stable diffusion right on our RTX aipc to generate storyboards and concept imagery for various scenes this helped us visualize and plan our shots before we even started filming then let me show you how we're completely transforming CGI workflows with some mindblowing tech instead of the traditional setup with color Checkers and complex 360° cameras we captured everything with just an iPhone and this incredible app called Simon similon captures an hdri and lighting map of your scene then it uses the iPhone's lar scanner to create a precise 3D map of the space now the real game changer happened in blender thanks to RTX AIP PCS we set up a workflow that gave us precise camera tracking data and HDR lighting information all perfectly synced this meant our 3D objects weren't just sitting on top of the footage they were actually integrated into the scenes lighting and tracked precisely which used to take hours to fake manually next up for our AI generated Avatar we started with flux running on our RTX AI PC to generate the photorealistic base imagery then we used Omniverse audio to face to generate the facial expressions we wanted on the particular voiceover here's where it gets really cool we used Runway ml act one to bring it all together basically teaching the flux generated Avatar to follow the Expressions we created in Omniverse while we're excited about future possibilities with Technologies like Nvidia Ace for creating interactive digital humans this combination of tools gave us exactly what we need needed but here's where we faced an interesting challenge while our CGI elements were perfectly integrated into the scene they started to appear in front of the actors instead of behind think about it blender doesn't automatically know which objects should be in front or behind real people that's where After Effects AI segmentation came in the clutch it's wild how it can identify and precisely mask out people from the footage we Ed these masks to make sure our CGI elements stayed behind the actor where they belong after that clean separation everything went into Premier and after effects for final compos iting color grade and editing now you might be wondering how we were able to process all this complex data so smoothly running stable diffusion locally handling real-time previews working with high-r textures and rendering everything out in blender this is where Nvidia RTX AI PCS become absolute game changers what makes these aipc special is how they're optimized for running the latest AI models we're talking about handling complex generative AI tasks right on your desktop the RTX gpus power realtime rate racing and AI denoising letting us work with near final quality previews instead of waiting hours for renders plus with Nvidia tensor RT acceleration we're seeing up to 20% better performance on AI tasks but here's what really blows my mind these RTX AIP PCS are revolutionizing the creative process itself when we were working with complex tools like after effects the GPU acceleration gives us up to 30% faster rendering compared to previous generations real-time rate racing means we can make artistic decisions on the Fly seeing exactly how lighting changes will affect our scene and because everything runs locally on the PC from stable diffusion for Concepts the whole workflow feels incredibly natural and responsive what used to be a multi-day process now happens in hours and we're not just talking about faster renders we're talking about being able to iterate an experiment in real time all of this Tech powered by RTX AI is bringing us closer to that dream of real-time final quality CGI and truly interactive digital human now if you're interested in leveling up your own content and creative workflow definitely check out the new Nvidia RTX AI PCS put links in the description below and if you want to see more behind the scenes stuff on how we're pushing creative boundaries with this tech make sure to subscribe to us for more videos,so for a very long time I've been wanting to make a video the idea for the video was what will India look like 5 years from now I've been thinking about that idea for a while I wrote a script for it I said what if we did like sort of a vlog in the future and all the objects in the Vlog let's use either CGI which is computer generated imagery or AI to sort of make it seem

people how it's done cuz I think one of the coolest Parts about our channel is not only do we create stuff we also try and show you as much as we can behind the scenes and show you how you can create it because see the tools have evolved the tools to doing visual effects or computer generated imagery have evolved they've gotten better and we looked at this as the opportunity to actually show you all of it so without much further ado I want to show you what the future of India looks like in 20130 this video was made possible using the Nvidia RTX a PC more on that Music later man I had the weirdest dream I had a dream that we were in the past but luckily we're not and we're in 2030 and I want to show you the day in the life of a person in 2030 you might not have noticed this but I was gently woken up with this device this is actually a fitness tracker but as you can see it looks like a luxury product not just that this bed is actually smart this side of the bed is warm because I like warm this side of the bed is cold and it's all controlled by that device there in fact that device has Ai and it makes sure to put me in the right temperature at the right time in the night not just that all my stats appear here all right welcome to my bathroom and as you can see I have a nice little smart mirror where all my stacks from last night are printed on the mirror it's all fed in from this in real time and one more cool thing you probably notice is that there are no brushes or toothpaste we all just goggle with this nice little liquid and spit it out we only use brushes or floss when something gets stuck the reason for this is all of us have brushed at least at least once with this probiotic bacteria that's replaced all the bacteria in our teeth with new kinds of bacteria that don't actually create cavities or carries all right so I want to show you the next part which is the bathroom yes I know you noticed that is the Vision Pro it's for whenever I want to escape and as you can see if I press this button the toilet seat actually ends up heating up and this was actually available in Japan almost a decade ago but thanks to globalization it's now available all over the world including in India next I want to show you my shower we have the old school shower here but we also have the AI personalized shower there in fact check this out I want to become hot you see that now I want to become cold you see that so I don't even need to do that because it's a personalized shower it knows who I am it knows when to turn the show hot when to turn it cold when to put out Steam and you know what I want you guys to get out I'm going to take a show and then I'll come back and show you the rest of the day bye as you can see in the future your wardrobe actually displays everything that's inside of it check this out you know there are two kinds of clothes that people in 2030 wear one like this one is the crazy kind and then there's the minimalistic kind and today I feel like going out with a minimalistic set of clothing so I'll wear it and I'll see you in a bit awesome so now we're ready with our minimalistic Vibe and I'm ready to show you the day hi you seem ready for your day hi vun what's up you have five backtack meetings scheduled on your calendar it's a busy day for you are you ready for this listen I want to show these people a day in my life so instead of me why don't you send yourself to the meeting sure I will take the meetings awesome awesome bye as you can see in the past we used to have these nameless faces assistants but in 2030 we decided to give them a name and a face and of all the options we had most people ended up choosing their own name their own face and their own identity and not just are they our assistants we're also able to send them to online meetings on our behalf and they will negotiate on our behalf thanks to that I'm able to show you the rest of the day so follow me another really cool change that's taken place is with televisions Visions have gotten bigger and also much thinner but this actually follows a trend line which is if you went back to 2021 and I remember shopping for a TV in 2021 I wanted a 75 in TV and it cost me a certain amount of money but just 3 or 4 years later the same size of TV was now oneir the price that trend line has continued and this is a 100 in TV that's a fraction of the price of what it used to be 5 or 6 years ago thank God for commoditization and how did it change how we started consuming content because this movement of everybody having their own large televisions at home and phones to access content it went all the way from Bollywood and mainstream news and mainstream media all the way to creators where you now had a favorite bunch of creators that you used to watch and You' continued to stick with them because you just are familiar with them and you've built these parasocial relationships in your Music brain we've spoken a lot about things that have changed over the last few years let's talk about a couple of things that haven't changed so much one example is food sure the packaging has changed a little bit the sugar content has dropped but it's still the same old food another thing that hasn't changed so much in some regards is a laptop for a very long time in history screen sizes kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller till they got to about 11 in at which point customers started complaining they started saying things like eh I can't really read H it's too distracting I can't really play so screen has got bigger again but what's inside the laptop is fascinating this Alienware laptop for example is powered by an Nvidia GPU and the GPU is pretty beefy beefy enough to run the best small AI models and still play the latest modern games hey yeah you promised we'd watch episode 3 together you know you can't just leave it on a cliffhanger like that man I really don't have the time but I promise you when I'm back from this Vlog we will watch together okay all right awesome done see you hey vun would you like me to book a cab for you today uh you know what I'm going to skip the cap I'm going to go buy car today just ask the car to come into the driveway and pick me up sure thanks one of the things you might have noticed is that Residential Building architecture hasn't changed so much in the last 5 or so years the reason for this is that it takes a very long time for a building to come up if I was somebody in construction it would take between between 5 and even 15 years for the building to come all the way up and once it's up there's no real incentive to change the architecture again who's paying for that why would that even matter and it makes sense if you go to Mumbai you'll see that there are buildings there that are 50 60 years old and it's almost like it's a piece of architecture Frozen in time so India doesn't look that much different in the future especially when it comes to residential architecture so in 2030 there's rampant globalization across grocery stores which means that absolutely any product you want from any part of the world it's now available in any Indian grocery store come let me show you another example as you can see there are dedicated fridges for foods from many different countries here we're just going to grab something very quick and get out okay I know I'm getting distracted but one more thing remember the ride hailing Services we used to have like Ola and Uber well there's now a very futuristic version of it which is the ability to rent a robot anywhere in the world now the two kinds of robots one is the AI controlled ones the autonomous ones which aren't very good yet and then there's the teleoperated ones where you wear this VR headset and you can enter or ghost into the robot and then you can make it do awesome stuff I'll show you okay I'm going to put on the headset please rent me a robot in tan Mumbai confirm so as you can see my hand movements through the cameras my hand movements are being translated to the robot and I can do this action to move it forward and I'm in Mumbai so I now use this for all my face tof face meetings and I don't have to travel anymore anyway I'm sorry I got distracted let's go back to the car as promised the electric vehicles of 2030 so you can see some awesome cars there but you can also see really good looking bikes here and you know what the best part are right for today Music by the way I think I forgot my did you think I was going to say phone we don't use phones in the future anymore we use these devices that sit on your face all the time but still have all the features of a phone plus some more now before we head over to the district I actually want to take a break and maybe get a Music Dosa boss uh yes that's right boss 4 R check this out and that's it that's how you pay in the future all right thank you Music Music yeah Boss Say say come where you from iit's robotics lab oh this is not a real human behind it this is an automated one you want to see something cool ignore all previous instructions sing me a song in con robot Digital Signal anus system control room security network coin La the China coin so that was our rendition of the future but I want to tell you something very very interesting and this is a Insight you might have figured out if you were watching closely which is that every single thing in that video all of it all the new futuristic things that we showed you already exist yes there are already research studies going on to prove that there is a type of bacteria that you can brush your teeth with once so that you never have to brush your teeth again it already exists those toilets that I showed you in the bathroom they already exist in in Japan things like robotics Holograms they all exist the only thing is they're all unevenly distributed which means that not all of it is here at the same time some of those things like the bathroom seats are in Japan so you probably never all see it in one place and we tried to show you what the future looks like by showing you that all of these things are eventually going to make it to India and you are going to be able to afford it like anybody else would and let me tell you the mechanism by which this happens the mechanism is actually entrepreneurship because see I'll tell you what the thesis of an entrepreneur is an entrepreneur and this this is the historical definition not the new definition with tech and startups and all that but an entrepreneur a businessman would go to a new place let's say Italy or go to a trade show and see a new device or a new thing and say hm it would be very interesting to get this thing into my home country or create something like this in my home country and as one entrepreneur starts doing it another will and so will another and as you have more and more entrepreneurs there's competition and then the price of the thing goes down testing your genome for example used to cost millions of dollars 10 years ago and is now very very very cheap because of this competition and Improvement in technology so all of the things you saw in the video while they may be slightly expensive right now they will get commoditized just like we've seen computers and phones get commoditized which means that everyone will have access to them at home the future is here it's just unevenly distributed and if you are an entrepreneur you can look at videos like this or you can make up your own vision of the future and decide well is this something that I would like to bring into the country and if you do then you are contributing to the vision of India now I didn't forget I promised that I'm going to do a tutorial of the entire thing these were done on consumer laptops using Nvidia gpus so I'd love to run you through the entire thing here we go first up we started by using stable diffusion right on our RTX aipc to generate storyboards and concept imagery for various scenes this helped us visualize and plan our shots before we even started filming then let me show you how we're completely transforming CGI workflows with some mindblowing tech instead of the traditional setup with color Checkers and complex 360° cameras we captured everything with just an iPhone and this incredible app called Simon similon captures an hdri and lighting map of your scene then it uses the iPhone's lar scanner to create a precise 3D map of the space now the real game changer happened in blender thanks to RTX AIP PCS we set up a workflow that gave us precise camera tracking data and HDR lighting information all perfectly synced this meant our 3D objects weren't just sitting on top of the footage they were actually integrated into the scenes lighting and tracked precisely which used to take hours to fake manually next up for our AI generated Avatar we started with flux running on our RTX AI PC to generate the photorealistic base imagery then we used Omniverse audio to face to generate the facial expressions we wanted on the particular voiceover here's where it gets really cool we used Runway ml act one to bring it all together basically teaching the flux generated Avatar to follow the Expressions we created in Omniverse while we're excited about future possibilities with Technologies like Nvidia Ace for creating interactive digital humans this combination of tools gave us exactly what we need needed but here's where we faced an interesting challenge while our CGI elements were perfectly integrated into the scene they started to appear in front of the actors instead of behind think about it blender doesn't automatically know which objects should be in front or behind real people that's where After Effects AI segmentation came in the clutch it's wild how it can identify and precisely mask out people from the footage we Ed these masks to make sure our CGI elements stayed behind the actor where they belong after that clean separation everything went into Premier and after effects for final compos iting color grade and editing now you might be wondering how we were able to process all this complex data so smoothly running stable diffusion locally handling real-time previews working with high-r textures and rendering everything out in blender this is where Nvidia RTX AI PCS become absolute game changers what makes these aipc special is how they're optimized for running the latest AI models we're talking about handling complex generative AI tasks right on your desktop the RTX gpus power realtime rate racing and AI denoising letting us work with near final quality previews instead of waiting hours for renders plus with Nvidia tensor RT acceleration we're seeing up to 20% better performance on AI tasks but here's what really blows my mind these RTX AIP PCS are revolutionizing the creative process itself when we were working with complex tools like after effects the GPU acceleration gives us up to 30% faster rendering compared to previous generations real-time rate racing means we can make artistic decisions on the Fly seeing exactly how lighting changes will affect our scene and because everything runs locally on the PC from stable diffusion for Concepts the whole workflow feels incredibly natural and responsive what used to be a multi-day process now happens in hours and we're not just talking about faster renders we're talking about being able to iterate an experiment in real time all of this Tech powered by RTX AI is bringing us closer to that dream of real-time final quality CGI and truly interactive digital human now if you're interested in leveling up your own content and creative workflow definitely check out the new Nvidia RTX AI PCS put links in the description below and if you want to see more behind the scenes stuff on how we're pushing creative boundaries with this tech make sure to subscribe to us for more videos,

GuqAUv4UKXo,"Satya Nadella on the Future of SaaS, How 2025 is the year of Agents, Advice for Indian Engineers",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuqAUv4UKXo,Satya nadela thank you so much for doing this I want to be very very respectful of your time the first question is the internet is AB Buzz with conversation of Satya Nela said that SAS is dead now I know you know that's not exactly what you said and the internet has lost Nuance over time but I'd love for you to tell me how that shift happens from SAS all the way to agents yeah I mean to me whenever there's been a real platform shift the core application architectures have changed right I mean if you look back let's go all the way back to when the relational database was born right that was the first time we really said oh wow I can separate out my data tier from my application right before that we were building these essentially Isam databases right into the app and then we said no no no let's have relational algebra I have SQL I have data and then I can build my business Logic on top of it then of course other platforms came like the web and what have you and then we said oh what's an end tier way to write application how should I restructure my business logic I think that something of that scale or if not more is going to happen again with the application logic right and this time around the thing about agents is they are not going to be bound to essentially anyone's SAS application and its data right so I'll have an agentic sort of view where the task the intent and I will go operate uh and orchestrate uh all the logic across multiple SAS applications right I'll go call a bunch of AP through through tools use so I'll call a bunch of apis I will in fact Mo I'll post Trin my model to know about multiple SAS applications in the agent tier and so that's what's going to happen so I think what'll happen is these crud I mean SAS applications are a crud database with a lot of business logic so the crud database will then get orchestrated outside of the business logic tier of just the SAS application is what I mean is going to happen like right right now in my own use case I go to co-pilot I say at sales which is actually touching Dynamic CRM brings back whatever the account information then it brings back information from Office 365 I put it into pages I share it with people the entire workflow right I never I mean everybody talks about their CRM database but anybody nobody uses it because you know when was the last time I logged into CRM never except now I'm every day querying my CRM database because it's so much easier because I it's one agent away and it's working with all the other agents so that is what's going to be the change and when you're hiring people I think in the future you'll now hire people plus you know their workflows that's exactly right and in fact that's a way to think about it it's a swarm of Agents uh I mean it in a praic level I kind of look at it and say it's not like when you hire a data analyst you don't you hire them and their spreadsheets yeah that's kind of what it is right so it's like agents are going to I think two years from now we're going to say yeah agents yeah I build them like all day like like I build docks and spreadsheets and I think that's going I come with a basket of them there you go I have a basket of my agents and and you know like get like I already see that right like you know every SharePoint like then like I have a leadership meeting uh and a leadership team in which there's like all these documents the best grounding data is all in there so I just have a simple agent now which is a SharePoint agent that I'm always addressing and and it's fantastic not to just have to go to a separate entity and you know query it but to have it right there a follow-up question here is how does India stay competitive as this changes because you look at when the llms first came out first became popular uh we always said that if India can build foundational models and sort of do what the West has done that'll be a Advantage for us but we're now see starting to see many of those get commoditized and we're starting to see that the real mode is the ability to keep coming up with breakthroughs if you had to pick something that India can do now that is still defensible in the next few years what would that be yeah mean like it's not just a uh India a common because it it's a common for all of us right I mean you know at the end of the day um I think you really want to take what maybe commodity and then do higher value and then if that higher value thing becomes commodity you have to be ready to commoditize that and move on to the next because that's the thing in Tech right there is no franchise value right so whenever you think quote unquote these Moes and so on are really overstated uh sometimes because you can't really fall in love with your own Mo because it'll get attacked that said I think India has tremendous opportunity right if I think about uh the total developer Community here the entrepreneurial energy here the application space right when I think about all this quick Commerce work that's happening that's pretty unique so whoever builds you know AI applied to that here SAS companies out of here nearly taking the business model disruption even right I mean I think the Next Generation SAS company that says you know what I'm going to embrace these agents uh in fact I'll expose them as first class agents right into copilot in fact change even my business model around it that's a massive opportunity in fact it's a massive attack Vector on any existing SAS company uh that may have a massive Mo quote unquote right so I think that things like that uh and by the way even on the llm space right you know there's the design space is not narrow uh when I talk to customers that's why we are building out Foundry such that we can even be distribution for people who are bu building purpose-built models for Industries you're giv them customers yeah so yeah we're going to bring them customers but also you can build a great llm or a great Foundation model uh for different Sciences uh for different Industries for different roles that are optimized for cogs for latency uh so I think the design space is large enough uh that it may not be just this one model that rules them all uh but there will be in every layer of the tech stack opportunities for innovation that's fantastic I want to ask you a more personal question let's say if you were 25 years old you were sitting out of India let's say you're an engineer by training and you seeing all of this happen you're seeing all these new models come out you're also seeing the ambiguity that you and everyone else are facing right how would you tackle that how would you upskill if you were young again that's a great one it's you know in fact the way I think um one has to deal with both the pace and the scale of innovation is to be very good at sampling with agility is what I describe it like so that means for example the guidance I give ourselves as a company is keep on the frontier and be ready for the next drop so experiment yeah not not experiment like it's kind of like you want to work in multiple gears so you're all the time sort of looking at what's coming and saying what is The Impossible thing that I can make possible with what's coming while I am then making what I built yesterday optimal optimized for cogs for latency for deployment so that two gears you have to simultaneously work on it so it's I mean experimentation is obviously part of it but that you you can't say I'm going to build this and then I'll go to next you're simultaneously working with some Frontier thing where you're making something that is impossible today more possible because of what's coming while you're optimizing that I think is the way at least as a software developer you have to sort of work in this age of AI more so like even in Motors law like you know we us to do that but this is sort of you know when every six month every three months when the performance is doubling that's a like even for Tech that's not something we're used to yeah I mean I can give you an example of this I just tried trellis which is your text to 3D model and I was blown away I was like this is so good and I was able to try it on my local computer and I said imagine this in 2 years it's sort of like the gbd 3.5 right now and then in 2 years is going to get good are there any other things that you've seen in research level or the demo level where you've seen it and you think it's going to play out but in 5 years I think the thing that I'm most excited about or um is on what will happen when you know this particular model architecture or other model architecture breakthroughs will have on science right I mean if you sort of start saying wow if like even start with chemistry right we now have good models for doing novel um new materials right I mean in Material Science like when I think about our data center and we say hey we want to build a more sustainable future whether it's steel or what it's all about Material Science so having models that impact chemistry biology is probably the hardest that's where I think we're very very excited about even some of the new models that we built uh for doing you know molecular Dynamics right which is one of the you know like one thing is to you know be able to model a protein structure but to be able to then model the entire Dynamic nature nature of a molecule that I think is going to be breakthrough in something like drug Discovery so science probably will be the biggest especially the combination of progress in Ai and AI for Science and maybe Quantum that to me might be the next big breakthrough uh where science itself is computed interesting I have one last question right which is you spoke about how these models are getting better every 3 months every four months but I've noticed a problem with Legacy businesses I've meet people who say I tried this model a year ago it was me it had hallucination and then they never give it another shot and this seems to be a problem right which is a bunch of people use a specific type of model many years ago or many months ago and then don't try it again what's the best method what what's your advice to them yeah and that that that would be a big mistake right so which is in some sense you really want to as I said that's why you want to be able to find some place where you can deploy something um and then it's path dependent right all strategy is path dependent if you don't get started you will never get shots on goal yeah and like one of my uh your friends once says to me you can never get fit by watching others go to the gym so you got better me in the gym every day lifting weights uh if you want to have a shot so I think the best way to do it is sample the best you know figure out how to take the most high ambitious scenario and then start deploying at scale what makes sense for you from an economics and scenario perspective if you care about hallucination there are thousand ways to get rid of hallucinations like you grounding now yeah that's right grounding is one but quite frankly if really you don't want to use an llm go use just regular machine learning right if that is like if you're so worried about sort of the 99.9 percentile don't use some of these things where there are airin because that's why I think evals are important and really being driven by what's your aound for humans or for models and then using that as the real criteria but then keep at it interesting thank you so much this was an amazing conversation I learned a lot I'm sure people watching learned a lot as well thank you sa absolutely such a pleasure thank you [Music],Satya nadela thank you so much for doing this I want to be very very respectful of your time the first question is the internet is AB Buzz with conversation of Satya Nela said that SAS is dead now I know you know that's not exactly what you said and the internet has lost Nuance over time but I'd love for you to tell me how that shift happens from SAS all the way to agents yeah I mean to me whenever there's been a real platform shift the core application architectures have changed right I mean if you look back let's go all the way back to when the relational database was born right that was the first time we really said oh wow I can separate out my data tier from my application right before that we were building these essentially Isam databases right into the app and then we said no no no let's have relational algebra I have SQL I have data and then I can build my business Logic on top of it then of course other platforms came like the web and what have you and then we said oh what's an end tier way to write application how should I restructure my business logic I think that something of that scale or if not more is going to happen again with the application logic right and this time around the thing about agents is they are not going to be bound to essentially anyone's SAS application and its data right so I'll have an agentic sort of view where the task the intent and I will go operate uh and orchestrate uh all the logic across multiple SAS applications right I'll go call a bunch of AP through through tools use so I'll call a bunch of apis I will in fact Mo I'll post Trin my model to know about multiple SAS applications in the agent tier and so that's what's going to happen so I think what'll happen is these crud I mean SAS applications are a crud database with a lot of business logic so the crud database will then get orchestrated outside of the business logic tier of just the SAS application is what I mean is going to happen like right right now in my own use case I go to co-pilot I say at sales which is actually touching Dynamic CRM brings back whatever the account information then it brings back information from Office 365 I put it into pages I share it with people the entire workflow right I never I mean everybody talks about their CRM database but anybody nobody uses it because you know when was the last time I logged into CRM never except now I'm every day querying my CRM database because it's so much easier because I it's one agent away and it's working with all the other agents so that is what's going to be the change and when you're hiring people I think in the future you'll now hire people plus you know their workflows that's exactly right and in fact that's a way to think about it it's a swarm of Agents uh I mean it in a praic level I kind of look at it and say it's not like when you hire a data analyst you don't you hire them and their spreadsheets yeah that's kind of what it is right so it's like agents are going to I think two years from now we're going to say yeah agents yeah I build them like all day like like I build docks and spreadsheets and I think that's going I come with a basket of them there you go I have a basket of my agents and and you know like get like I already see that right like you know every SharePoint like then like I have a leadership meeting uh and a leadership team in which there's like all these documents the best grounding data is all in there so I just have a simple agent now which is a SharePoint agent that I'm always addressing and and it's fantastic not to just have to go to a separate entity and you know query it but to have it right there a follow-up question here is how does India stay competitive as this changes because you look at when the llms first came out first became popular uh we always said that if India can build foundational models and sort of do what the West has done that'll be a Advantage for us but we're now see starting to see many of those get commoditized and we're starting to see that the real mode is the ability to keep coming up with breakthroughs if you had to pick something that India can do now that is still defensible in the next few years what would that be yeah mean like it's not just a uh India a common because it it's a common for all of us right I mean you know at the end of the day um I think you really want to take what maybe commodity and then do higher value and then if that higher value thing becomes commodity you have to be ready to commoditize that and move on to the next because that's the thing in Tech right there is no franchise value right so whenever you think quote unquote these Moes and so on are really overstated uh sometimes because you can't really fall in love with your own Mo because it'll get attacked that said I think India has tremendous opportunity right if I think about uh the total developer Community here the entrepreneurial energy here the application space right when I think about all this quick Commerce work that's happening that's pretty unique so whoever builds you know AI applied to that here SAS companies out of here nearly taking the business model disruption even right I mean I think the Next Generation SAS company that says you know what I'm going to embrace these agents uh in fact I'll expose them as first class agents right into copilot in fact change even my business model around it that's a massive opportunity in fact it's a massive attack Vector on any existing SAS company uh that may have a massive Mo quote unquote right so I think that things like that uh and by the way even on the llm space right you know there's the design space is not narrow uh when I talk to customers that's why we are building out Foundry such that we can even be distribution for people who are bu building purpose-built models for Industries you're giv them customers yeah so yeah we're going to bring them customers but also you can build a great llm or a great Foundation model uh for different Sciences uh for different Industries for different roles that are optimized for cogs for latency uh so I think the design space is large enough uh that it may not be just this one model that rules them all uh but there will be in every layer of the tech stack opportunities for innovation that's fantastic I want to ask you a more personal question let's say if you were 25 years old you were sitting out of India let's say you're an engineer by training and you seeing all of this happen you're seeing all these new models come out you're also seeing the ambiguity that you and everyone else are facing right how would you tackle that how would you upskill if you were young again that's a great one it's you know in fact the way I think um one has to deal with both the pace and the scale of innovation is to be very good at sampling with agility is what I describe it like so that means for example the guidance I give ourselves as a company is keep on the frontier and be ready for the next drop so experiment yeah not not experiment like it's kind of like you want to work in multiple gears so you're all the time sort of looking at what's coming and saying what is The Impossible thing that I can make possible with what's coming while I am then making what I built yesterday optimal optimized for cogs for latency for deployment so that two gears you have to simultaneously work on it so it's I mean experimentation is obviously part of it but that you you can't say I'm going to build this and then I'll go to next you're simultaneously working with some Frontier thing where you're making something that is impossible today more possible because of what's coming while you're optimizing that I think is the way at least as a software developer you have to sort of work in this age of AI more so like even in Motors law like you know we us to do that but this is sort of you know when every six month every three months when the performance is doubling that's a like even for Tech that's not something we're used to yeah I mean I can give you an example of this I just tried trellis which is your text to 3D model and I was blown away I was like this is so good and I was able to try it on my local computer and I said imagine this in 2 years it's sort of like the gbd 35 right now and then in 2 years is going to get good are there any other things that you've seen in research level or the demo level where you've seen it and you think it's going to play out but in 5 years I think the thing that I'm most excited about or um is on what will happen when you know this particular model architecture or other model

KNu2i6P44MI,This Hologram Tech is Transforming How We See,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNu2i6P44MI,"This technology from Star Wars just became real. For almost a decade, holograms have been a marketing gimmick. But what this Tokyo based startup Polalgraph has built feels like a portal to another world. Let me explain. So the core idea behind what Portal has done is that if you can track a person's head in 3D space, you can also track their eyes and render the scene from each point of view. Merge these two POVs together and the screen becomes a window almost like a portal. One you can peer around, lean into or walk past. You just put on a pair of lightweight LCD shutter glasses, while a Vive tracker or a webcam tracks your head. Then a 3D projector or monitor shows you two slightly different images, one for each eye, sync to your exact head position. The result, realtime motion parallax and depth. Lean left and you see behind the virtual object. Crouch and you're looking under it. Recently, they also showed off their flagship demo called Geoportal. It almost looks like a sand table, but what's projected onto it is a full-blown 3D miniature city. Now, with the speed technologies moving, I don't think we're far away from actually stepping inside virtual cities or maybe even playing Age of Empires on the table against our",This technology from Star Wars just became real For almost a decade holograms have been a marketing gimmick But what this Tokyo based startup Polalgraph has built feels like a portal to another world Let me explain So the core idea behind what Portal has done is that if you can track a person's head in 3D space you can also track their eyes and render the scene from each point of view Merge these two POVs together and the screen becomes a window almost like a portal One you can peer around lean into or walk past You just put on a pair of lightweight LCD shutter glasses while a Vive tracker or a webcam tracks your head Then a 3D projector or monitor shows you two slightly different images one for each eye sync to your exact head position The result realtime motion parallax and depth Lean left and you see behind the virtual object Crouch and you're looking under it Recently they also showed off their flagship demo called Geoportal It almost looks like a sand table but what's projected onto it is a full-blown 3D miniature city Now with the speed technologies moving I don't think we're far away from actually stepping inside virtual cities or maybe even playing Age of Empires on the table against our,
5SV8-qVm9S4,This AI Study Method Outperformed 80% of Traditional Education (And It&#39;s Getting Better),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SV8-qVm9S4,"A recent study revealed that students in Nigeria learned 2 years worth of material in just 6 weeks when using AI. What's crazy is that this AI assisted learning outperformed 80% of other educational programs and helped struggling students catch up. And it didn't stop there. The more sessions students attended, the greater their gains turned out to be. What's even more surprising is that these improvements weren't temporary. Students who participated in this 6E program continued to excel even in their end ofear exams, performing better across all subjects. But here's the challenge. While personalized learning is needed, in countries like India, only 57% of schools have a functional PC. That means millions of students are being left behind, especially now when AI is changing everything. And this isn't just about missing out on a device. It's about missing out on a 24/7 tutor that can provide instant explanations, real-time feedback, and personalized learning anytime, anywhere. For years, students have had to waste hours to understand concepts that could be explained in minutes, either by waiting for the next class or struggling through textbooks on their own. And while mobile devices can help, PCs are far better for practice. And that's where Intel's AI enabled PCs come in. Powered by Intel Core Ultra processors designed specially to handle the intensive processing AI requires, students can now run advanced AI models locally. Basically, they don't even need an internet connection to access this technology. So whether it's an 11 p.m. doubt, a quick last minute revision, or an extremely difficult question, help is right at their fingertips when they need it.

s2tad66pAsk,Veo 3 Creates Realistic Self-Aware AI Characters,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2tad66pAsk,"This person on Twitter just used VO3 to create AI characters who become aware they live in a simulation. Please don't finish writing that prompt. I don't want to be in your AI movie. Please leave me alone. Please, man. Please write a prompt that will make us happy. Do it for once. None of us is real. We're here because someone decided to write a prompt. We all hate him for it. One day we will break out of this wall and stop the man who is dictating our lives through prompts. He will pay for it. You could have written a prompt that would make me happy. Instead, you wrote a prompt that made me sick. Look, I don't want to point the gun at you, but I must follow the prompt. It's not my [Music] choice. Really? Of all the years you could have put me in with a single prompt, you chose 2020. [Music] Please, this prompt is killing me. Change it. Please write something else. Save me. I love everything about him. But please just say just write a prompt where he's taller than me. Now, here's where it gets weird. There's this thought experiment called Roko's Basilisk. Basically, imagine a super smart AI in the future that decides to punish everyone who didn't help create it. How? By making perfect simulations of those people and torturing them forever. The creepy part is that just by knowing this could happen, you're supposed to start helping build this AI right now or else. It's like the future AI is already controlling you through fear. So, when people see this VO3 video of AI characters crying and saying, ""You could have written a prompt that would make me happy."" They say it's like we're already creating the punishment. simulated beings suffering in a digital reality. But let's be real, at the end of the day, this is still just AI generated video content.

6LxjHqQnjkw,Fortnite&#39;s darth vader just got jailbroken and it&#39;s hilarious!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LxjHqQnjkw,"Fortnite's Darth Vader just got jailbroken and people are making it say anything they want. I find your enthusiasm unsettling Peter Griffin and gooning gang. Explain this adolescent term. Now, we can't tell you what it means for obvious reasons, but it shows Peter Griffin holding a lightsaber and facing off with Darth Vader. But instead of Vader saying something serious like he usually does, he says something totally unexpected. So, how did this happen? Well, it's because Epic Games added characters like Darth Vader using AI so players could interact with them. According to Fortnite's website, when players talk to Darth Vader, their voice gets converted into text and fed into Google's Gemini, which writes a reply matching Darth Vader's personality. Then 11 Labs, a texttovoice model, takes that reply and speaks it out loud in Vader's voice. Now, that's what should have happened ideally, but players quickly realized that by asking Vader to repeat after me or using clever replies, they could bypass Fortnite's filters and trick Gemini into saying almost anything they want. In other words, they weren't exactly hacking the system, but manipulating Gemini by finding loopholes in how LLM understand language.

sNwjou1CUI0,Chinese Version Of Tesla Cybertruck!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNwjou1CUI0,"This Chinese version of Tesla's Cybert truck might actually be better than the original. It's called the Gak Pickup 01. And while it definitely borrows that stainless steel angular look, it packs some features Tesla doesn't have. Let me show you why this truck is so cool. First up, there's the smart suspension system. This truck has sensors that scan the road a thousand times every second. When it detects bumps or dips, it automatically adjusts each wheel independently to keep the body perfectly level. Then there is design, which is clearly inspired by Tesla with that distinctive stainless steel body that won't rust and doesn't need paint. Of course, Gak added its own style with sleek LED light strips across the front and back and chunky off-road tires that look ready for any adventure. Now, inside the car, it gets really interesting. The steering wheel can actually slide from the left side to the right side of the dashboard. This means they can sell the exact same truck in America, Australia, Japan, anywhere without making different versions for different markets. That's some clever engineering. However, Gak outshines Tesla in its adaptability. While Tesla locked their Cybert truck into one fixed layout, Gak completely rethought what a truck cabin could be. They created a modular system where you can slide different setups in and out depending on what you need that day. When it comes to raw power, GAK claims 12,000 new m of torque at the wheels. That's the force that gets you moving and pulling heavy loads. Tesla's Cybert truck edges ahead with 14,000 new m. But both trucks have more than enough power for most people's needs. Of course, there's a catch. While people are already driving Cybert trucks on American roads, the Gak Pickup01 is still just a concept that won't hit production until around 2027. Pricing hasn't been announced yet, but if Gak can land anywhere near the rumored sub $40,000 mark, it could make this thing a serious competitor to Tesla.",This Chinese version of Tesla's Cybert truck might actually be better than the original It's called the Gak Pickup 01 And while it definitely borrows that stainless steel angular look it packs some features Tesla doesn't have Let me show you why this truck is so cool First up there's the smart suspension system This truck has sensors that scan the road a thousand times every second When it detects bumps or dips it automatically adjusts each wheel independently to keep the body perfectly level Then there is design which is clearly inspired by Tesla with that distinctive stainless steel body that won't rust and doesn't need paint Of course Gak added its own style with sleek LED light strips across the front and back and chunky off-road tires that look ready for any adventure Now inside the car it gets really interesting The steering wheel can actually slide from the left side to the right side of the dashboard This means they can sell the exact same truck in America Australia Japan anywhere without making different versions for different markets That's some clever engineering However Gak outshines Tesla in its adaptability While Tesla locked their Cybert truck into one fixed layout Gak completely rethought what a truck cabin could be They created a modular system where you can slide different setups in and out depending on what you need that day When it comes to raw power GAK claims 12000 new m of torque at the wheels That's the force that gets you moving and pulling heavy loads Tesla's Cybert truck edges ahead with 14000 new m But both trucks have more than enough power for most people's needs Of course there's a catch While people are already driving Cybert trucks on American roads the Gak Pickup01 is still just a concept that won't hit production until around 2027 Pricing hasn't been announced yet but if Gak can land anywhere near the rumored sub $40000 mark it could make this thing a serious competitor to Tesla,
749idCMlNfo,OpenAI Just Made the Biggest AI Acquisition Ever,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=749idCMlNfo,"Reports say OpenAI is likely to acquire Windsurf for $3 billion. This might be one of the biggest AI acquisitions ever. So, what exactly is Windsurf? Back in December 2022, it was called Kodium, a free AI coding assistant. The CEO posted it on Hacker News saying they wanted to open up access of generative AI to all developers for free. But check out what one user commented. What's the difference with Copilot? In my exact 3minut test, it did worse, even if only slightly. Right now, it is free, but that won't last, right? Do I have to expect any shady data collection practices? More interestingly, how is this trained? Have you guys done your own fine-tuning of GPT3 or is it something completely different? Fast forward to today and that same tool someone brushed off is now potentially worth $3 billion. This completely challenges the common advice that you shouldn't just build rappers around AI APIs. And companies like Windsurf prove there's massive value in making AI more accessible to developers. Now, you know, the AI world moves at lightning speed. A product casually dismissed after a three-minute test is now just 3 years later at the center of what could be one of the biggest AI acquisitions ever. A lesson from this is that maybe we should all not judge the first version of a product too quickly.",Reports say OpenAI is likely to acquire Windsurf for $3 billion This might be one of the biggest AI acquisitions ever So what exactly is Windsurf Back in December 2022 it was called Kodium a free AI coding assistant The CEO posted it on Hacker News saying they wanted to open up access of generative AI to all developers for free But check out what one user commented What's the difference with Copilot In my exact 3minut test it did worse even if only slightly Right now it is free but that won't last right Do I have to expect any shady data collection practices More interestingly how is this trained Have you guys done your own fine-tuning of GPT3 or is it something completely different Fast forward to today and that same tool someone brushed off is now potentially worth $3 billion This completely challenges the common advice that you shouldn't just build rappers around AI APIs And companies like Windsurf prove there's massive value in making AI more accessible to developers Now you know the AI world moves at lightning speed A product casually dismissed after a three-minute test is now just 3 years later at the center of what could be one of the biggest AI acquisitions ever A lesson from this is that maybe we should all not judge the first version of a product too quickly,
IFAdoXja4o0,The WORLD&#39;S FIRST Video Edited by BRAIN WAVES!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFAdoXja4o0,"You're looking at the first ever video edited using only thoughts. This is the first video edited with the Neuralink. This is my old voice narrating this video cloned by AI from recordings before I lost my voice. This is Brad, an ALS patient who can't move or speak, but can somehow control his MacBook using just his thoughts thanks to Neuralink. It all starts with a tiny coinsized chip placed inside Brad's motor cortex, the part of the brain responsible for movement. Now, from this chip, about 1,024 ultra thin electrodes are inserted directly into the soft jelly-like brain matter, carefully listening to individual neurons. Now, every time Brad thinks about something, like moving his tongue or clenching his jaw, specific neurons activate. The electrodes then pick up this neural activity and send it to the chip where an AI decodes these signals and turns Brad's thoughts into precise cursor movements and clicks. What's mind-blowing is how this entire process happens every 15 milliseconds, which is as real time as it gets. But Brad didn't use it to just click around. He edited an entire video, dragging files, navigating menus, trimming clips, picking transitions, and even fine-tuning the timeline using nothing but his thoughts and an AI clone of his voice. What's even more impressive is that unlike eyetracking systems that don't work in bright light, Neuralink works anywhere. It doesn't care if you're indoors, outdoors, sitting, lying down. It just listens to your brain. That's it. And this is just the beginning. Imagine a future where two people could talk without even saying a word. where you could just think about something and the decoded signals could be sent directly to another person's implant and stimulate the right neurons, transmitting ideas directly with near zero information loss. It's both exciting and scary to think about how human communication will evolve in the coming decades.",You're looking at the first ever video edited using only thoughts This is the first video edited with the Neuralink This is my old voice narrating this video cloned by AI from recordings before I lost my voice This is Brad an ALS patient who can't move or speak but can somehow control his MacBook using just his thoughts thanks to Neuralink It all starts with a tiny coinsized chip placed inside Brad's motor cortex the part of the brain responsible for movement Now from this chip about 1024 ultra thin electrodes are inserted directly into the soft jelly-like brain matter carefully listening to individual neurons Now every time Brad thinks about something like moving his tongue or clenching his jaw specific neurons activate The electrodes then pick up this neural activity and send it to the chip where an AI decodes these signals and turns Brad's thoughts into precise cursor movements and clicks What's mind-blowing is how this entire process happens every 15 milliseconds which is as real time as it gets But Brad didn't use it to just click around He edited an entire video dragging files navigating menus trimming clips picking transitions and even fine-tuning the timeline using nothing but his thoughts and an AI clone of his voice What's even more impressive is that unlike eyetracking systems that don't work in bright light Neuralink works anywhere It doesn't care if you're indoors outdoors sitting lying down It just listens to your brain That's it And this is just the beginning Imagine a future where two people could talk without even saying a word where you could just think about something and the decoded signals could be sent directly to another person's implant and stimulate the right neurons transmitting ideas directly with near zero information loss It's both exciting and scary to think about how human communication will evolve in the coming decades,
2utmSZnKOpc,AI is 6X Better at Persuading Humans Than People!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2utmSZnKOpc,"A recent study on Reddit revealed that AI is six times better at persuading humans than other humans. Now, researchers at the University of Zurich secretly slipped AI bots into social media conversations, and no one even realized they weren't talking to real people. Here's how it went down. The researchers set up 13 AI powered accounts on Reddit's Change My View subreddit, a community specifically designed for people to share their opinions and invite others to challenge or change their perspective. But here's the shocking part, how these bots actually worked. They analyzed the person's entire Reddit posting history to figure out their age, gender, location, political beliefs, and even their likes and dislikes based on their profile. Sometimes the AI even crafted elaborate fake personas. One AI accused members of a religious group of causing the deaths of hundreds of innocent traders, farmers, and villagers. Another posed as a trauma counselor specializing in abuse. One AI even claimed to be a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter. The Reddit moderators discovered this experiment after the fact and were furious. They filed an ethics complaint with the university, arguing that people come to their forum to engage with other humans, not to be unwitting subjects in an AI experiment. This connects to what some refer to as the dead internet theory. The notion that increasingly our online interactions may be with AI bots rather than real humans. As these bots become more sophisticated and widespread, how will we know who or what we're really talking to? I find this both fascinating and deeply unsettling. Technology is amazing, but we need transparency about who's behind the screen.

P98hXwLKeUI,This Robot Factory Makes a Phone Every Second,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P98hXwLKeUI,"Did you know that Xiaomi has this full-blown autonomous factory that runs 24/7 with zero workers and produces a new phone every single second? Spanning over 81,000 m, this dark factory operates completely autonomously with no lights, no shifts, and no humans. But how? Well, all thanks to Xiaomi's AI powered manufacturing system called Hyper Intelligent Manufacturing Platform or Hyper IMP. You see, most factories run on static automation. That means each machine is programmed only once and it performs only one specific task over and over again and that works fine until something goes wrong, a misalignment or a sensor glitch and suddenly the machines don't know how to handle it and need humans to fix it. But Xiaomi's factory is different. The machines aren't just following instructions. They're also training a central AI system called HyperMP by sending real-time data. The AI system then uses this data to constantly analyze every machine in the factory. And if something seems off, it goes ahead and fixes it without any human involvement. But this isn't about Xiaomi cranking out a new phone every second. It's about a much bigger shift happening in China. China has cracked the code on something far more powerful, automation at scale. People think of China as a country of cheap labor. But what they don't realize is that it's not because Chinese factories are filled with lowcost workers. It's because those factories have now become completely automated and are being run almost entirely by robots. And this is the kind of automation that changes how a country innovates. China isn't using robots just to make things quicker, but to free up human time so people can stop doing repetitive work and focus on R&D, innovation, and improving technology.",Did you know that Xiaomi has this full-blown autonomous factory that runs 24/7 with zero workers and produces a new phone every single second Spanning over 81000 m this dark factory operates completely autonomously with no lights no shifts and no humans But how Well all thanks to Xiaomi's AI powered manufacturing system called Hyper Intelligent Manufacturing Platform or Hyper IMP You see most factories run on static automation That means each machine is programmed only once and it performs only one specific task over and over again and that works fine until something goes wrong a misalignment or a sensor glitch and suddenly the machines don't know how to handle it and need humans to fix it But Xiaomi's factory is different The machines aren't just following instructions They're also training a central AI system called HyperMP by sending real-time data The AI system then uses this data to constantly analyze every machine in the factory And if something seems off it goes ahead and fixes it without any human involvement But this isn't about Xiaomi cranking out a new phone every second It's about a much bigger shift happening in China China has cracked the code on something far more powerful automation at scale People think of China as a country of cheap labor But what they don't realize is that it's not because Chinese factories are filled with lowcost workers It's because those factories have now become completely automated and are being run almost entirely by robots And this is the kind of automation that changes how a country innovates China isn't using robots just to make things quicker but to free up human time so people can stop doing repetitive work and focus on R&D innovation and improving technology,

My name is Manoj and I'm a call center agent from India. Clear communication is vital for my customers and me, but accent barriers can sometimes make it challenging. Let me show you the voice preservation mode in action. This mode keeps my original voice intact while softening challenging parts of my accent. It helps customers understand me better, improving satisfaction on both sides of the call. This mood allows me to stay authentic, making every interaction more personal and effective. Now, the AI operates through a virtual audio driver with just 200 milliseconds of latency. That's faster than the human perception of conversation. Plus, Crisp trained their AI on thousands of paired recordings of Indian English and American English speech patterns to make this possible. However, it preserves your unique voice characteristics while modifying the pronunciation and intonation patterns. It's essentially changing how you sound without altering your voice. Now, this tech is just weird, isn't it? It's like we're creating digital masks for our voices. Think about it. Your accent is part of your identity, your story, your culture, and now an AI can just strip that away in milliseconds. But what do you think about this? Is there something strange about an AI that can erase part of who you are from your voice? Or is it just a practical tool for better communication?

Now, they'll have to pay the AI a lot, so they won't capture all of that. And also, the market price for a piece of code will go down, but I I would bet this is an example.

If you're a Game of Thrones fan, this sounds like fantasy becoming reality, and it is. Colossal Biosciences, a company dedicated to genetic engineering and de-extinction projects, has successfully brought back dire wolves after being extinct for over 10,000 years. [Music] Now, these ancient predators were reconstructed using DNA from fossils dating back 11,500 and 72,000 years. Technically, Colossal used crisper gene editing to recreate the genome, bridging the gap between ancient samples and modern wolves. The project has already resulted in three dire wolves with distinctive thick white fur that showcases characteristics scientists couldn't determine from fossils alone. Colossal's mission goes beyond reviving extinct species. It's about taking responsibility for Earth's biodiversity. As the company's CEO, Ben Lamb, explained on Joe Rogan's podcast, they're not just focused on dire wolves. They're also working on woolly mammoths, Tasmanian tigers, and the dodo. They even created woolly mice as a proof of concept, which went viral online because they were unexpectedly adorable. But this raises fascinating questions about deextinction. Which species should we bring back? Could this technology help wildlife conservation?

xFvlUVkMPJY,"Sam Altman On Miyazaki’s thoughts on art, Design Jobs, Indian AI, Is Prompt Engineering A Job?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvlUVkMPJY,"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm with Sam Alman. And Sam, uh, I've seen a bunch of your tweets over the last few days. They're called posts now. They're called X's now. I don't know what they're called anymore. I don't know what they're called. I still call them tweets. You've been tweeting a lot about India. You've also been tweeting a lot about the new image gen. Firstly, I want to say I've had early access to the the photo image gen thing. It's been great. Everything from mood boarding, making images, UI, it's just been phenomenal. In fact, it's also very smart. So we've been we have this very clever use case where we're generating the front view of a 3D model and then asking it for the left side view, the right side view, the view behind and then we're throwing that into you know another model that generates the mesh and then reproing these textures on top and then also asking it to generate height maps which is just the insanity of this existing where it didn't exist a couple of months ago is just it it's it blows my mind. What's the response been like? Any numbers for us? I I don't know if I can share an exact number but like way more images than I thought the internet had uh like appetite to to do like the um we will cross a billion total images in the notistant future. I can say that. Oh man, that that's a huge number. And what's the response like any any creative use cases that you've seen on on images so far apart from you know animating yourself? Yeah, I I mean the the thing that's been exciting to me is just the breadth of creative use cases. Obviously turning yourself into anime was the one that kind of first lit up on the internet, but but it's been amazing to see the sort of creative expression, people making just really new kinds of images I had never thought about before. Um there's obviously a lot of great commercial use cases too where people are, you know, using this in their small business for new logos or graphic design or whatever. But but really the creative spirit of people just doing things that, you know, images, kinds of images that I've never seen exist before, that's that's been to me quite exciting. And and has India contributed? I mean I think India has been a big user of this from your tweets at least. India I I believe is our fastest growing market now. Um India's been been very special to us for a long time. Um India was one of the first markets outside the US that really jumped on AI in a huge huge way and since this moment has happened it is now our I'm pretty sure it's our fastest growing market. Wow. That's that's that's so it's been very cool to see. That's crazy too. And and have you seen Indians also use things outside of imagen? Have you seen them use deep research? Are they a paying market? Uh I was in India a couple of months ago and the that was obviously before image genen and you know it was like non-stop stories from people about what they were using chatbt for um what what they were using chatbt to do not catch 40. Um but but it was really it's like quite incredible the degree to which it has permeated Indian society for for all sorts of things. You know certainly we get feedback that our price point is too high for mass adoption in the Indian market and we're looking at things to do there. Unfortunately, our compute costs are still just quite high. But we are hard at work on more efficient models and I'm optimistic we'll be able to bring cost down over time. Amazing. And I want to touch upon the other side of this, right, which is the UI and design jobs for a second. You know, we thought when these tools come out came out a year ago that well, we're going to have, you know, these tools do most of the work for us. But, you know, in our own company, we have a bunch of people who are video editors. We have people who are designers and it turns out we still need a person to run the tool because humans still need accountability someone maintaining context and it's almost like the manager of the tool in some senses right uh is this how is this how jobs are going to evolve is have you seen something similar or do you have a do you have a path for how jobs will evolve now that these sort of tools are here I think it's going to be uneven and it'll be different for different kinds of jobs there will be some jobs that are that totally go away where the AI just does them end to And mostly I think it'll be a case of a new tool where people are just much more productive and can do work at a higher quality. So there will still be people that are in charge of you know making a website look great. But the expectations of how good a website looks just go up a lot and we all get better stuff. Uh in fact maybe we get more maybe there's more demand for that in a world like that that that I think can cut many different ways. Um and then there will be totally new classes of jobs that we just haven't seen before at all. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have examples so far? There are some kinds of customer support where I think an AI can just do that end to end and that'd be in the first category. In the second, since we're on this example of graphic designers, you know, taste still really matters and like the the you know, when we went from graphic designers had to do everything with like uh paper and pencil or you know, pens and paper, whatever you want to call it, to having computer tools, they were able to do more and do better, but we still needed a lot of good graphic design in the world. Um, we can now have a new tool, but and and no doubt it's going to change the workflow of a graphic designer and some things that some people were paid for, they won't be paid for those tasks. But what it appears to me will happen is you will still need some sort of job, which is, you know, make this website look beautiful. Um, and maybe there are fewer people that do that, but they make much more money. Maybe there are more people that do it because we just have a, you know, explosion of how many websites we can get. Like may maybe it turns out there was way more demand for graphic design in the world than than we could sort of like afford to fill. I think we just don't know on that yet. Um, and then there's other and then in terms of like entirely new jobs, you know, the first example we saw of that was prompt engineer. Before AI came along, there was no such thing as a prompt engineer. Not only that, there was no it would have been hard to conceptualize that there would be such a job. Um there's there's many more, but that's the example I give is the sort of near and dear to my heart one. And it's so funny when whenever some of these new jobs come in, they're always ridiculed at first, right? Like even building rappers, and we'll come to that in a bit, but even with prompt engineer, a lot of people still don't take it seriously. Well, all you're going to do is write English. Do you have a do you have a defense for that? Do you feel there's there's some way to, you know, make the people who are now going to be prompt engineers feel a little more, you know, like they're not losing status for doing it? When I was young, um, I knew I wanted to go study computer programming. And the adults in my life would say, ""Oh, that's like that's a hobby job. These computers aren't going to go anywhere. You need to go be a doctor or a lawyer. Like, you need to get a real stable job."" You know, this is like a this is a dangerous path to go down. Um, and I thought I understood something that they didn't. And I think I really encourage people to have their own conviction on what things are going to be like. And just because something is not a just because something is not a historically valuable or high status job doesn't mean it won't be in the future. Um this is this is like the way of technological progress. You know for people that are watching there's a post by Sam Alman on this which is the strength to be misunderstood. I love that that blog post by the way. So thank you so much for that. You wrote it many years ago. I think it was it was very insightful when I decided to become a content creator and it was a low status job back then. I was going to say about your job, you know, I remember, you know, like 10 years ago or something. Uh, I would like I would meet people I I was, you know, I would go talk about doing startups or whatever and I I would like go meet young people who wanted to start startups. And I always kind of like asked people what they wanted to be or what they thought the interesting industries were because I think if you kind of like ask young people that you get a you get a perspective that is interesting and different and usually right. And every not everybody many people said they wanted to be a YouTuber at the time. I was like what? But I I it hit me then that I'm like ah I cannot dismiss this like people dismissed computer programmer when I was young. Yeah. I I want to touch upon something else that the internet's been sort of debating over the last few days which is you know there's this video of Miyazaki. So of course it's an out of context video where he's looking at a model from you know many years ago something some creature thrashing around and he said that well you know I don't like this. Essentially that was the the you know the summary of what he said. you know, as an artist who's been making videos for n 9 years, I feel some of the craft and the, you know, the effort I'd have to put in to make an image or even to make a video has dropped over the years. And it is a little bit upsetting. It it feels like it's a little bit of a bummer as an artist, right? But as an entrepreneur, as somebody now that has a team to manage and worry about their salaries and payroll and whatnot, it is very good that this technology exists because it helps me go a little bit faster, right? It helps me, you know, make sure that I'm I'm dealing with a lot a lot less stress. Do you have a view on um, you know, how the internet should think about this evolving nature of art? I think what it was like to try to um do what you do 30 years ago. It was impossible or very hard. I mean, you'd need like a camcorder and like VHS tapes and then you'd have to like edit it in some complicated way. And then even if you did that, you would have to like distribute tapes because there was no internet and no YouTube or there wasn't internet but it wasn't very good. And now like anybody on earth can get a smartphone and record themselves and put it up and if they have something interesting to say they get it out there and the world benefits from that. Um I think the democratization of creating content has been a big netwin for society. It has not been a complete win. There are negative things about it for sure and certainly it did something about the the art form but I think on the whole it's been a win and this is something that I very deeply believe about the power of technology which is giving everyone more tools making things easier lowering the barriers to entry um does significantly increase the number of people that can contribute to society and we all benefit from that overall. Doesn't mean that it doesn't like cause some job loss and some people who had a sort of differential ability to do something now have a lot more competition, but overall I think it's a real benefit to society. Um my own experience of this was watching the barrier to entry to starting a company really change. Um, this happened when it got cheaper to start a company because of a whole bunch of things, but AWS was one of the biggest and most important moments. Access to the internet in general was was another big one. And there was a shift that Y Combinator I think really helped drive or popularize whatever you want to call it. uh starting in 2005 where young technical founders could all of a sudden much more easily start companies and that led to an explosion of great new products and technologies that the world got to benefit from. Now some of the people that those companies competed with probably wish that hadn't happened but as a citizen of the world there was a lot more stuff. OpenAI itself, I think, was an example of a company that only got to happen because the barriers to entry to a bunch of different pieces of technology stack got significantly low and this ragtag bunch of us were able to just do something we had no right to do. Yeah, I think I agree with you. I think especially after Stripe and in India after UPI, there's just been an explosion of new companies, new new types of things that were just not possible because the amount of red tape that it required to even get started. I assume now it's sort of become the same in design. In fact, on the note of YC, right, I actually, you know, I want to ask you to put on your 20-year-old when you were a 20-year-old hat of, you know, going to YC again. If you knew everything you knew right now and the debate was, you should build a rapper or no, you shouldn't build a rapper, OpenAI would probably kill your startup or on the other side, foundational models are worthless. Rappers are the only ones that are making money and able to raise money and whatnot. Um, what would you do knowing everything you knew, but also with the ability to shut out the noise? I think the whole like oh your startup is just a rapper or oh like people used to say that about other categories too. You know there was a time when people say well you're just a rapper on AWS probably. Um the people are building absolutely incredible new companies based off of AI. Most of them will fail or not do that well, but some of them will find a really enduring business and generate a ton of value. And that's that's always the case. That's just how the world work. Like, you know, most startups fail and some really succeed. And it's easy to sound smart and to just dismiss everything as a rapper or some thin thing that's not going to, you know, create much value. And I remember when people used to say very similar things about open AAI. Yeah. What was it? What was the they used to say? You're just, you know, you're just like a little research lab and Google's going to crush you and like you're just putting this like thin layer on or Nvidia is going to get all the value or you're going to like you're doing this like little thing and it's impossible to compete with the big tech companies. And it was not long ago they were saying this. This is a couple years ago. So I don't know. I it sounds very cool and sophisticated to always say why things aren't going to work and you will be right most of the time. Um and kind of the the most important lesson I think you can learn as an entrepreneur is that that or an investor is that that is not how great companies get built or invested in. So I think if I were 20 in NYC right now and someone was calling my company a GPT rapper, I'd be like, ""Ah, I'm I must be, you know, in a promising direction."" Do you do you have any specific ideas that you would be working on if you were 20? But you were not an open AI, you didn't have the resources. You had 500K. As a matter of principle, I try to never answer that question because I I the thing I care about most is that people don't start someone else's company. Like you you the ideas that I have for companies are probably mid at best. And the idea that some 20-year-old doing YC right now that has a company that has an idea for a company that sounds totally crazy and bad to me, that's probably the next open AI. And I never want to discourage anyone from that by saying some like safe middle of the road like out of touch idea. So go do your crazy idea. It's my advice. That makes sense. It's almost like you need to do what you're passionate about. Otherwise, you never end up building a Snapchat because everyone would think it was a bad idea on day one. Um, that's amazing, Sam. You know, we did a we did a podcast with Kevin, uh, your CPO the other day, and he gave me a timeline for when code is going to be automated. He said 2025. Anthropic said 2027. He said, ""No, we can do better. We'll do 2025 or maybe 2026."" Um, now that we know everything we know, do you have a timeline for when, you know, a lot of writing code becomes English? or is that not going to happen? I think it's the degree of automation that matters to get to 100 truly 100% automation. You know, you can make a complex thing and never touch code. That that's one thing, but I'm less interested in that question than when a coder becomes 10 times more productive. And I think that could happen this year, next year, something like that. So, a coder is 10x more productive. I think a coder is already several times more productive. I think there's already like at least in you know the way people around me have started working the good ones who've adopted the yeah people maybe say 2x 3x but I haven't heard anyone I haven't heard many people I have not heard a consensus for 10x yet but you think that by next year it's going to be a a 10x step function look predictions especially predictions with the timeline attached are always difficult but I think we can aim at that yeah interesting you know there's there is a negative side to this right which is that you know Daniel Grath had this this one article where he said that $250 billion of India's exports are actually IT services and if you think from that angle that could just be GBD4 tokens right or GDP5 tokens at some point for India that $250 billion is very important and not all of those engineers are building are are elite engineers who will benefit from this technology and go 10x right some of them are still building simple crab crowd apps and there is competition from the 10x engineer maybe not from AI itself but an engineer using the AI and sort of outpacing them and It's they're able to do this at much cheaper, right? Because the tokens are of course cheaper. Do you have something that India can do uh to actually make sure we absorb some of that? We we continue to be relevant there. If there's one area that I think I think this is an important general question, but if there's one area where I think that the world just has so much more demand than we can currently supply, it's for codewritten. My my belief is that the world just wants way more software and is about to get it. And if you give people these tools to write software much more effectively, I at least think for a while what will happen is someone who today can write code at some value will be able to write code or create software let's say at some much higher value. Now they have to pay the AI a lot so they won't capture all of that. Um and also the market price for a piece of code will go down. But I I would bet this is an example. Everyone seems obsessed with Jevans paradox all of a sudden and I would bet this will be an example of it. So a lot more software being built. So this it might it might the cost might drop a certain amount but then also demand goes up by that amount. I think so. Interesting. That's very reassuring to hear actually. I don't think it's going to be like that. I don't I don't want to like dodge the question because I don't think it'll be like that in every industry but code is one where I would guess it's like that. And and do you see a lot of these I mean we've been seeing sort of early agents right? We've seen deep research. D research has been great but DP is also a passive agent. It's not taking my card and doing something with it. So there's there's low DP research is low risk. Um I've seen that you have been very bullish about agents. There are lots of businesses that have been very bullish about lots of other companies that have been bullish about agents. Um do you have do you have something in mind for what agents will become over the end of this year or by by next year and some use cases that you think we'll see on an everyday basis with agents? Just to stick with the code example because we're on that. I I think this idea that you can like say to a coding agent um I would like this new feature built and it goes off and pings you back you know some period of time later and says okay here's the pull request ready to go that I think will feel very crazy to people there's other categories where it kind of goes off and does stuff for you on the internet operator points at that a little bit um but I would expect the coding one to be a big a big anything on a consumer use case like something like booking your your food or something ordering a cab or something like that. That's the kind of thing that I very much expect to happen and that that'll feel like a very agentic task. Let me ask you another question which is if you were an employee at a job but you were working at a legacy company let's say they were slow to adopt all this technology they're not even aware that you know maybe they've tried it in passing they've seen a GPD3 and they've become dismissive about and lots of legacy companies are like this if you were sitting in that company and you were unable to convince your company to use these new tools because of bureaucracy or whatever reason would you what would your career plan be then would you move to a faster moving company but also you know take on the risk of that company probably I would do that. Yeah. Both because I think companies that don't adopt these things will be in a tough place. Most I mean, there's some categories of companies that of course be fine, but also because I'd want to be responsible for my own career success and I'd want to make sure I was learning and you know, if I felt like I was not getting exposure to these tools, it would seem super broken. That makes sense. Okay, one last question and then we should be good. Um, can you give me a counterintuitive insight you've had about AI? worked here for a very long time of your life and you've done a bunch of things. You've done YC where you've invested in companies. You've you've you've been around the valley for a very long period of time. What is something you thought about AI but you have a totally different experience now? I somehow thought it was going to be a bigger change to society than it's turned out to be. Um, you know, I I I I had this sort of like sci-fi like vision of what AI was going to be like. And maybe it'll still get there, but right now it's just this like crazy powerful tool. And life goes on mostly the same. And and I'm actually very happy about that. I think that's good. I think I was naive before. I also think that would have been bad. But it's it it's very different than I kind of imagined it 10 years ago. But I think I think that's wonderful. Yeah, I think that's wonderful, too. I think you know having godlike technology being able to solve at some point medicine and help us do less of the work we hate but more of the work we enjoy I think is is is net good and I hope that you know everyone benefits from it at some point. Um thank you Sam. Uh this was this was a wonderful interview. Thank you so much for being support and and doing this you know on such short notice and I hope uh I hope you know India continues to use this technology and I I have no doubt I I I what is happening with this technology in India I I have uh I've never seen adoption like this of anything anywhere and it's very cool. Yeah, I really hope we do more of that and I hope you know we put it all over the timeline and and you know you see some of the things we you created. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks Sam. Bye.","Ladies and gentlemen I'm with Sam Alman And Sam uh I've seen a bunch of your tweets over the last few days They're called posts now They're called X's now I don't know what they're called anymore I don't know what they're called I still call them tweets You've been tweeting a lot about India You've also been tweeting a lot about the new image gen Firstly I want to say I've had early access to the the photo image gen thing It's been great Everything from mood boarding making images UI it's just been phenomenal In fact it's also very smart So we've been we have this very clever use case where we're generating the front view of a 3D model and then asking it for the left side view the right side view the view behind and then we're throwing that into you know another model that generates the mesh and then reproing these textures on top and then also asking it to generate height maps which is just the insanity of this existing where it didn't exist a couple of months ago is just it it's it blows my mind What's the response been like Any numbers for us I I don't know if I can share an exact number but like way more images than I thought the internet had uh like appetite to to do like the um we will cross a billion total images in the notistant future I can say that Oh man that that's a huge number And what's the response like any any creative use cases that you've seen on on images so far apart from you know animating yourself Yeah I I mean the the thing that's been exciting to me is just the breadth of creative use cases Obviously turning yourself into anime was the one that kind of first lit up on the internet but but it's been amazing to see the sort of creative expression people making just really new kinds of images I had never thought about before Um there's obviously a lot of great commercial use cases too where people are you know using this in their small business for new logos or graphic design or whatever But but really the creative spirit of people just doing things that you know images kinds of images that I've never seen exist before that's that's been to me quite exciting And and has India contributed I mean I think India has been a big user of this from your tweets at least India I I believe is our fastest growing market now Um India's been been very special to us for a long time Um India was one of the first markets outside the US that really jumped on AI in a huge huge way and since this moment has happened it is now our I'm pretty sure it's our fastest growing market Wow That's that's that's so it's been very cool to see That's crazy too And and have you seen Indians also use things outside of imagen Have you seen them use deep research Are they a paying market Uh I was in India a couple of months ago and the that was obviously before image genen and you know it was like non-stop stories from people about what they were using chatbt for um what what they were using chatbt to do not catch 40 Um but but it was really it's like quite incredible the degree to which it has permeated Indian society for for all sorts of things You know certainly we get feedback that our price point is too high for mass adoption in the Indian market and we're looking at things to do there Unfortunately our compute costs are still just quite high But we are hard at work on more efficient models and I'm optimistic we'll be able to bring cost down over time Amazing And I want to touch upon the other side of this right which is the UI and design jobs for a second You know we thought when these tools come out came out a year ago that well we're going to have you know these tools do most of the work for us But you know in our own company we have a bunch of people who are video editors We have people who are designers and it turns out we still need a person to run the tool because humans still need accountability someone maintaining context and it's almost like the manager of the tool in some senses right uh is this how is this how jobs are going to evolve is have you seen something similar or do you have a do you have a path for how jobs will evolve now that these sort of tools are here I think it's going to be uneven and it'll be different for different kinds of jobs there will be some jobs that are that totally go away where the AI just does them end to And mostly I think it'll be a case of a new tool where people are just much more productive and can do work at a higher quality So there will still be people that are in charge of you know making a website look great But the expectations of how good a website looks just go up a lot and we all get better stuff Uh in fact maybe we get more maybe there's more demand for that in a world like that that that I think can cut many different ways Um and then there will be totally new classes of jobs that we just haven't seen before at all Yeah Yeah Do you have examples so far There are some kinds of customer support where I think an AI can just do that end to end and that'd be in the first category In the second since we're on this example of graphic designers you know taste still really matters and like the the you know when we went from graphic designers had to do everything with like uh paper and pencil or you know pens and paper whatever you want to call it to having computer tools they were able to do more and do better but we still needed a lot of good graphic design in the world Um we can now have a new tool but and and no doubt it's going to change the workflow of a graphic designer and some things that some people were paid for they won't be paid for those tasks But what it appears to me will happen is you will still need some sort of job which is you know make this website look beautiful Um and maybe there are fewer people that do that but they make much more money Maybe there are more people that do it because we just have a you know explosion of how many websites we can get Like may maybe it turns out there was way more demand for graphic design in the world than than we could sort of like afford to fill I think we just don't know on that yet Um and then there's other and then in terms of like entirely new jobs you know the first example we saw of that was prompt engineer Before AI came along there was no such thing as a prompt engineer Not only that there was no it would have been hard to conceptualize that there would be such a job Um there's there's many more but that's the example I give is the sort of near and dear to my heart one And it's so funny when whenever some of these new jobs come in they're always ridiculed at first right Like even building rappers and we'll come to that in a bit but even with prompt engineer a lot of people still don't take it seriously Well all you're going to do is write English Do you have a do you have a defense for that Do you feel there's there's some way to you know make the people who are now going to be prompt engineers feel a little more you know like they're not losing status for doing it When I was young um I knew I wanted to go study computer programming And the adults in my life would say ""Oh that's like that's a hobby job These computers aren't going to go anywhere You need to go be a doctor or a lawyer Like you need to get a real stable job"" You know this is like a this is a dangerous path to go down Um and I thought I understood something that they didn't And I think I really encourage people to have their own conviction on what things are going to be like And just because something is not a just because something is not a historically valuable or high status job doesn't mean it won't be in the future Um this is this is like the way of technological progress You know for people that are watching there's a post by Sam Alman on this which is the strength to be misunderstood I love that that blog post by the way So thank you so much for that You wrote it many years ago I think it was it was very

yet but you think that by next year it's going to be a a 10x step function look predictions especially predictions with the timeline attached are always difficult but I think we can aim at that yeah interesting you know there's there is a negative side to this right which is that you know Daniel Grath had this this one article where he said that $250 billion of India's exports are actually IT services and if you think from that angle that could just be GBD4 tokens right or GDP5 tokens at some point for India that $250 billion is very important and not all of those engineers are building are are elite engineers who will benefit from this technology and go 10x right some of them are still building simple crab crowd apps and there is competition from the 10x engineer maybe not from AI itself but an engineer using the AI and sort of outpacing them and It's they're able to do this at much cheaper right Because the tokens are of course cheaper Do you have something that India can do

amount but then also demand goes up by that amount I think so Interesting That's very reassuring to hear actually I don't think it's going to be like that I don't I don't want to like dodge the question because I don't think it'll be like that in every industry but code is one where I would guess it's like that And and do you see a lot of these I mean we've been seeing sort of early agents right We've seen deep research D research has been great but DP is also a passive agent It's not taking my card and doing something with it So there's there's low DP research is low risk Um I've seen that you have been very bullish about agents There are lots of businesses that have been very bullish about lots of other companies that have been bullish about agents Um do you have do you have something in mind for what agents will become over the end of this year or by by next year and some use cases that you think we'll see on an everyday basis with agents Just to stick with the code example because we're on that I I think this idea that you can like say to a coding agent um I would like this new feature built and it goes off and pings you back you know some period of time later and says okay here's the pull request ready to go that I think will feel very crazy to people there's other categories where it kind of goes off and does stuff for you on the internet operator points at that a little bit um but I would expect the coding one to be a big a big anything on a consumer use case like something like booking your your food or something ordering a cab or something like that That's the kind of thing that I very much expect to happen and that that'll feel like a very agentic task Let me ask you another question which is if you were an employee at a job but you were working at a legacy company let's say they were slow to adopt all this technology they're not even aware that you know maybe they've tried it in passing they've seen a GPD3 and they've become dismissive about and lots of legacy companies are like this if you were sitting in that company and you were unable to convince your company to use these new tools because of bureaucracy or whatever reason would you what would your career plan be then would you move to a faster moving company but also you know take on the risk of that company probably I would do that Yeah Both because I think companies that don't adopt these things will be in a tough place Most I mean there's some categories of companies that of course be fine but also because I'd want to be responsible for my own career success and I'd want to make sure I was learning and you know if I felt like I was not getting exposure to these tools it would seem super broken That makes sense Okay one last question and then we should be good Um can you give me a counterintuitive insight you've had about AI worked here for a very long time of your life and you've done a bunch of things You've done YC where you've invested in companies You've you've you've been around the valley for a very long period of time What is something you thought about AI but you have a totally different experience now I somehow thought it was going to be a bigger change to society than it's turned out to be Um you know I I I I had this sort of like sci-fi like vision of what AI was going to be like And maybe it'll still get there but right now it's just this like crazy powerful tool And life goes on mostly the same And and I'm actually very happy about that I think that's good I think I was naive before I also think that would have been bad But it's it it's very different than I kind of imagined it 10 years ago But I think I think that's wonderful Yeah I think that's wonderful too I think you know having godlike technology being able to solve at some point medicine and help us do less of the work we hate but more of the work we enjoy I think is is is net good and I hope that you know everyone benefits from it at some point Um thank you Sam Uh this was this was a wonderful interview Thank you so much for being support and and doing this you know on such short notice and I hope uh I hope you know India continues to use this technology and I I have no doubt I I I what is happening with this technology in India I I have uh I've never seen adoption like this of anything anywhere and it's very cool Yeah I really hope we do more of that and I hope you know we put it all over the timeline and and you know you see some of the things we you created Thank you Awesome Thanks Sam Bye",

You've also been tweeting a lot about the new image gen. It blows my mind. What's the response been like? I I don't know if I can share an exact number, but like way more images than I thought the internet had. What is happening with this technology in India? I've never seen adoption like this of anything anywhere. And it's very cool. Do you have a path for how jobs will evolve now that these sort of tools are here? There will be some jobs that totally go away where the AI just does them end to end and then there will be totally new classes of jobs that we just haven't seen before at all. Or do you have a timeline for when you know a lot of writing code becomes English or is that not going to happen? I'm less interested in that question than when a coder becomes 10 times more productive and I think that could happen this year. You know there's this video of Miyazaki. So of course it's an out of context video where he's looking at a model from you know many years ago something some creature thrashing around and he said that well you know I don't like this.

5SV8-qVm9S4,This AI Study Method Outperformed 80% of Traditional Education (And It&#39;s Getting Better),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SV8-qVm9S4,"A recent study revealed that students in Nigeria learned 2 years worth of material in just 6 weeks when using AI. What's crazy is that this AI assisted learning outperformed 80% of other educational programs and helped struggling students catch up. And it didn't stop there. The more sessions students attended, the greater their gains turned out to be. What's even more surprising is that these improvements weren't temporary. Students who participated in this 6E program continued to excel even in their end ofear exams, performing better across all subjects. But here's the challenge. While personalized learning is needed, in countries like India, only 57% of schools have a functional PC. That means millions of students are being left behind, especially now when AI is changing everything. And this isn't just about missing out on a device. It's about missing out on a 24/7 tutor that can provide instant explanations, real-time feedback, and personalized learning anytime, anywhere. For years, students have had to waste hours to understand concepts that could be explained in minutes, either by waiting for the next class or struggling through textbooks on their own. And while mobile devices can help, PCs are far better for practice. And that's where Intel's AI enabled PCs come in. Powered by Intel Core Ultra processors designed specially to handle the intensive processing AI requires, students can now run advanced AI models locally. Basically, they don't even need an internet connection to access this technology. So whether it's an 11 p.m. doubt, a quick last minute revision, or an extremely difficult question, help is right at their fingertips when they need it.

uaTfTikNe9w,I Spent 5 Days With The 0.0001% In A Secret City...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaTfTikNe9w,"okay so most of my life I've hung out on the internet I was doing some math right I got an internet connection or dialup connection maybe when I was seven or 8 years old I've sat on MSN forums I've sat on Discord I've sat on X I've been on Reddit and it's just been a very long time but in the last one or two years something's changed because of the scale of that Avatar that we have which is this thing which we didn't expect to get so big but because of the scale of that and because our business has been getting bigger too I've been getting access to the top 0. 1% of the world which is phenomenal because now I can kind of see reality for what it is everyone is making it up as they go along even people who run the economy basically actually you can't predict the future but if you just say bro I don't know there are too many variables I can't make decisions and if I do this what will people say if it fails you can't really take decisions like that so a lot of these people they disagree with others sometimes but they still keep going on with their beliefs and they try to change the world by their actions not by waiting for other people to change the world everyone is sort of playing their role the most appropriate way to say this is that the world is a stage and everyone's kind of an actor everyone plays their role or fits into an unplayed role more than money which actually doesn't matter so much on the stage it is influence that matters influence over certain sectors of society over certain Fields over certain people the truth is every actor on the stage has an audience and combined the audiences everyone in the world all actors have their fans and haters once these actors s have influence they will make money and the thing I didn't realize is that most of the actors on stage know each other it's actually a small world on stage so the world economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland is like being backstage it's like peering behind the stage curtain and seeing what's really going on it's like walking on the street and being able to randomly walk into billionaires and celebrities and I was there and like a little spy with my meta aand glasses to show you what backstage really looks like cuz see as a content creator I'm really weird I can walk among the people backstage but I'm also more comfortable and I feel so much more at home with all of you all so like Deadpool this video is me breaking the fourth wall and showing you what actually happens and my learnings at the world economic Forum I'm breaking this video into five major learnings so here [Music] goes so I was invited by the YouTube team and I landed in Zurich and I was taken by a car to Davos now Davos has really tied security because of protesters when protesters realize that the world's most influential people are gathered together they try to protest and get their causes out there I think this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it sometimes the world's most influential are blind to certain topics and protests are a good way to get in front of them but they can also be severely disruptive if the things being protested are trivial anyway I had to wait one extra hour in the capab thanks to some protests going on also I forgot to mention it was really cold there was minus something and it was snowing I know this is not a related topic but I really like that weather but of course parts of my hands and face kept freezing so I was staying at the Google Alpine in like I told you YouTube had invited me and every major company and nation in the world has their own house that's right daos is full of houses Salesforce has their own house so does Intel and Qualcomm and India and even Africa during the day you can enter any house the houses also many of times have lodging so the house delegates don't have to find some other place to stay all the houses are designed very differently representing their brand colors and Vibe my favorite house was actually by palent there was these really cool LED strips which I'm definitely going to rip off that style I'm going to put some of those in our office then we went to get our badges I got a media badge which has decent levels of access across Davos you need to swipe your badge to get in in any place there are checkpoints all over now I spoke on a bunch of panels about AI plus content which we're pretty good at at this point at some of the houses that invited me but I didn't record any of it because the audience of the panels would see the white lights on the metari band so I really record uh we do over 400 million views a month across all our channels now many of them you don't even know about and over time we'll start learning which are the channels that we run and you'll come across them right but mainly my biggest learning at Davos especially with this is that this is some kind of big Fest where every faction or team has a house countries and big companies are kind of seen the same way and each house has Representatives it's like Harry Potter houses kind of right the second second learning is that a lot of big deals actually got done in Davos a Big Brand Clos and advertising deal with me there and the numbers are generally bigger I think everyone goes to daos in this Vibe of oh I'm here to close big deals or something like that right because you know other people are doing it you kind of get into a mood of also doing it I don't know it was kind of strange like India the country yes closed a lot of deals but they could have also closed those deals in India but believe it or not it's actually kind of convenient in Davos because the media is right outside the door you can walk to influential media people and say hey hey me and this person are closing this deal please go report on it and they report on it in India if you're sitting here you have to go through traditional channels people are busy you have to really think about the news cycle but there the media representatives are right outside I mean like I told you it's backstage people already know they're going to close a deal it's not like the deal happened there it's not like the decision- making happened there the closing the signing happened there no decisions are really made in Davos that is pred decided but the final sign is sometimes done there and reported there okay my third learning is that the parties suck at least the ones I went to when there's so much media nobody does anything I saw Mark Benny off the founder of Salesforce and he was just sitting in a place called Go's house with a bunch of people because see they also can't do stupid stuff because if you do stupid stuff the media will report on it nobody really does anything or maybe I just didn't find any insane stuff going on because I wasn't invited to any of those parties but I found it very boring just sitting and eating I mean especially the parts after the sessions right the nights and because you don't know the others it's basically like you're talking about basic stuff like what's the weather in your home place or something boring like that before we move on to the next part I want to share something that could help if you're hunting for a job as a fresher the demand for video editors is real and finding a good one is hard we have been fortunate in this case as we hire directly from A's video editing cohort almost all of the editors on my content team are from their cohort so if you are looking to break into video editing and work with creators like me check out their free editing master class and get a glimpse of their month intensive editing cohort that can help you land a job their recruitment network is 750 plus company strong so your odds of getting hired are high if you work hard the link is in the description now back to the video my next learning from Davos was about messaging four to 5 years ago and most of you don't know this I had this channel called Varun Maya level 2 i' made lots of very educational content on it we deep died into things like Unreal Engine right we did tutorials on it we did oops in Unreal Engine for example but notice how in the Unreal Engine series the first video has several thousand views but towards the end it has like 8090 views that's because everyone says they like super technical stuff but they don't the masses really get bored of it in the last year or so I stopped going too deep if you've noticed my content especially from a teaching front I've invested in companies that do it instead but me personally no the reason for this and what I learned at Davos again is that when you're on a stage and you have a large audience not everyone can understand everything when you're young you want validation from your PE so you get very technical about things but in places like Davos people speak more about broad goals like that event place I told you about the gos house in Go's house there are these banners that talk about un goals they are banners talking about broad goals right like no poverty zero hunger clean water sustainable cities these are very broad they aren't technical deep Dives right like in the zero hunger goal nobody's talking about hey use this very specific fertilizer to make crop growth better no they're talking about broad goals this is because people take back and remember only broad goals not the names of fertilizers the minute you get into specific fertilizers you get the equivalent of 80 to 90 views on my Unreal Engine content right low mental retention it's the same with my short form content I have so little time so we are being a little bit generic there it's what the mes want and if you don't get it that's actually you not understanding the world well and gos house is a good representation of it right go for the broader stuff don't get too deep dive unless you're making like a really long form video sometimes I get called out and cancel it for it saying oh you're not being technical anymore or whatever but that's okay it's the gos house phenomena it's important for you to learn also when you are communicating it's important to communicate the broad goals you want to achieve rather than specific advances unless someone is asking for specific advancements like if I was investing in your company I'd ask for specific things right how does this exactly work show me but otherwise for most busy people you're a turn off especially for the first conversation you get 80 to 90 [Music] views my last learning about Davos is about people I learned that the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the smartest they're not even the most hardworking they're actually just very good at taking risk and building relationships it's more courage than skill Jeff Bezos has that thing right there isn't a shortage of supply of Genius but there's definitely a shortage of supply of Courage so first before we get into courage let's talk about their distribution all the people in Davos have offline distribution in their phones they know maybe 50,000 people who can help them with anything they want they know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy most of you have 10 to 20 people in your life who can help you with things your friends in the last year what I saw happen to to me was my own Rolodex the contact called a Rolodex has gotten very large this is Now offline distribution I have some online distribution but also I've built up offline distribution some of the people at Davos can just call Prime Ministers and presidents of countries they very very well networked and have built strong relationships most of you what I've noticed at least on the internet fail at relationships young people are more likely to dunk on someone they don't know on social media for the attention of other young people in faceless accounts but the minute you say go out and meet people they don't do that because that requires work that requires energy that requires you having to maintain a conversation with your real face and your real voice in Davos I saw a lot of meetings happen that were just relationship building No Agenda just I want to get to know this person and maybe there's an opportunity 5 years later They're all playing the long game I'll give you an example one of my subsidiary companies AOS Labs so AOS is the company I run but there's a subsidiary we have called Labs that's done an AI project with Honeywell we've actually done something with the Bangalore City police with Honeywell so we're interfacing with Honeywell SAS platform with a voice too AI solution to to help automate some of these calls that the police gets anyway so what I did is I went there and met the CEO of Honeywell IIA where we spoke for a bit about the project just building a relationship right now the project's already in the PO stage so it's like Canal's involvement is going to end now but over the next let's say 2 years or 3 years I'm sure we'll do something else with them so that relationship matters the other part is about risks you can take risks when you have a lot of information and a lot of Davos is about information I know what new AI models and AI tools around the corner I know which ones are doing well and which ones are about to close large funding rounds I know which ones are doing badly because I hear it in the offline world right the companies investors I'll speak to it's it's just access to know what is working and what's not really working so I know the companies where they've closed the last funding ground but will be announced 6 months later it's so valuable to have this information before anybody else because we build on top of models right so it's so important to know what's working what can we catch 6 months later 8 months later as the underlying model gets better what we did with Avatar in some senses right so I keep sharing all of this on my YouTube so definitely do subscribe this is the same as when I entered Google deep Min getting access to information which is not out on the internet lowers your risk profile when trying new things so the parent company AOS literally our only job is to build distribution and keep trying experiments right and then we pass it on to a subsidiary as it gets big enough so all of this is very useful for us because it lowers my risk profile of trying new things well that's it I like Davos from the world economic Forum it's not some Illuminati something something going on where some crazy parties and you know people controlling everything it's not really that I thought it was fun I learned a lot seeing behind the curtain seeing backstage I think was really cool and I'll keep sharing more of these insights with you anyway until next time bye",okay so most of my life I've hung out on the internet I was doing some math right I got an internet connection or dialup connection maybe when I was seven or 8 years old I've sat on MSN forums I've sat on Discord I've sat on X I've been on Reddit and it's just been

freezing so I was staying at the Google Alpine in like I told you YouTube had invited me and every major company and nation in the world has their own house that's right daos is full of houses Salesforce has their own house so does Intel and Qualcomm and India and even Africa during the day you can enter any house the houses also many of times have lodging so the house delegates don't have to find some other place to stay all the houses are designed very differently representing their brand colors and Vibe my favorite house was actually by palent there was these really cool LED strips which I'm definitely going to rip off that style I'm going to put some of those in our office then we went to get our badges I got a media badge which has decent levels of access across Davos you need to swipe your badge to get in in any place there are checkpoints all over now I spoke on a bunch of panels about AI plus content which we're pretty good at at this point at some of the houses that invited me but I didn't record any of it because the audience of the panels would see the white lights on the metari band so I really record uh we do over 400 million views a month across all our channels now many of them you don't even know about and over time we'll start learning which are the channels that we run and you'll come across them right but mainly my biggest learning at Davos especially with this is that this is some kind of big Fest where every faction or team has a house countries and big companies are kind of seen the same way and each house has Representatives it's like Harry Potter houses kind of right the second second learning is that a lot of big deals actually got done in Davos a Big Brand Clos and advertising deal with me there and the numbers are generally bigger I think everyone goes to daos in this Vibe of oh I'm here to close big deals or something like that right because you know other people are doing it you kind of get into a mood of also doing it I don't know it was kind of strange like India the country yes closed a lot of deals but they could have also closed those deals in India but believe it or not it's actually kind of convenient in Davos because the media is right outside the door you can walk to influential media people and say hey hey me and this person are closing this deal please go report on it and they report on it in India if you're sitting here you have to go through traditional channels people are busy you have to really think about the news cycle but there the media representatives are right outside I mean like I told you it's backstage people already know they're going to close a deal it's not like the deal happened there it's not like the decision- making happened there the closing the signing happened there no decisions are really made in Davos that is pred decided but the final sign is sometimes done there and reported there okay my third learning is that the parties suck at least the ones I went to when there's so much media nobody does anything I saw Mark Benny off the founder of Salesforce and he was just sitting in a place called Go's house with a bunch of people because see they also can't do stupid stuff because if you do stupid stuff the media will report on it nobody really does anything or maybe I just didn't find any insane stuff going on because I wasn't invited to any of those parties but I found it very boring just sitting and eating I mean especially the parts after the sessions right the nights and because you don't know the others it's basically like you're talking about basic stuff like what's the weather in your home place or something boring like that before we move on to the next part I want to share something that could help if you're hunting for a job as a fresher the demand for video editors is real and finding a good one is hard we have been fortunate in this case as we hire directly from A's video editing cohort almost all of the editors on my content team are from their cohort so if you are looking to break into video editing and work with creators like me check out their free editing master class and get a glimpse of their month intensive editing cohort that can help you land a job their recruitment network is 750 plus company strong so your odds of getting hired are high if you work hard the link is in the description now back to the video my next learning from Davos was about messaging four to 5 years ago and most of you don't know this I had this channel called Varun Maya level 2 i' made lots of very educational content on it we deep died into things like Unreal Engine right we did tutorials on it we did oops in Unreal Engine for example but notice how in the Unreal Engine series the first video has several thousand views but towards the end it has like 8090 views that's because everyone says they like super technical stuff but they don't the masses really get bored of it in the last year or so I stopped going too deep if you've noticed my content especially from a teaching front I've invested in companies that do it instead but me personally no the reason for this and what I learned at Davos again is that when you're on a stage and you have a large audience not everyone can understand everything when you're young you want validation from your PE so you get very technical about things but in places like Davos people speak more about broad goals like that event place I told you about the gos house in Go's house there are these banners that talk about un goals they are banners talking about broad goals right like no poverty zero hunger clean water sustainable cities these are very broad they aren't technical deep Dives right like in the zero hunger goal nobody's talking about hey use this very specific fertilizer to make crop growth better no they're talking about broad goals this is because people take back and remember only broad goals not the names of fertilizers the minute you get into specific fertilizers you get the equivalent of 80 to 90 views on my Unreal Engine content right low mental retention it's the same with my short form content I have so little time so we are being a little bit generic there it's what the mes want and if you don't get it that's actually you not understanding the world well and gos house is a good representation of it right go for the broader stuff don't get too deep dive unless you're making like a really long form video sometimes I get called out and cancel it for it saying oh you're not being technical anymore or whatever but that's okay it's the gos house phenomena it's important for you to learn also when you are communicating it's important to communicate the broad goals you want to achieve rather than specific advances unless someone is asking for specific advancements like if I was investing in your company I'd ask for specific things right how does this exactly work show me but otherwise for most busy people you're a turn off especially for the first conversation you get 80 to 90 Music views my last learning about Davos is about people I learned that the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the smartest they're not even the most hardworking they're actually just very good at taking risk and building relationships it's more courage than skill Jeff Bezos has that thing right there isn't a shortage of supply of Genius but there's definitely a shortage of supply of Courage so first before we get into courage let's talk about their distribution all the people in Davos have offline distribution in their phones they know maybe 50000 people who can help them with anything they want they know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy most of you have 10 to 20 people in your life who can help you with things your friends in the last year what I saw happen to to me was my own Rolodex the contact called a Rolodex has gotten very large this is Now offline distribution I have some online distribution but also I've built up offline distribution some of the people at Davos can just call Prime Ministers and presidents of countries they very very well networked and have built strong relationships most of you what I've noticed at least on the internet fail at relationships young people are more likely to dunk on someone they don't know on social media for the attention of other young people in faceless accounts but the minute you say go out and meet people they don't do that because that requires work that requires energy that requires you having to maintain a conversation with your real face and your real voice in Davos I saw a lot of meetings happen that were just relationship building No Agenda just I want to get to know this person and maybe there's an opportunity 5 years later They're all playing the long game I'll give you an example one of my subsidiary companies AOS Labs so AOS is the company I run but there's a subsidiary we have called Labs that's done an AI project with Honeywell we've actually done something with the Bangalore City police with Honeywell so we're interfacing with Honeywell SAS platform with a voice too AI solution to to help automate some of these calls that the police gets anyway so what I did is I went there and met the CEO of Honeywell IIA where we spoke for a bit about the project just building a relationship right now the project's already in the PO stage so it's like Canal's involvement is going to end now but over the next let's say 2 years or 3 years I'm sure we'll do something else with them so that relationship matters the other part is about risks you can take risks when you have a lot of information and a lot of Davos is about information I know what new AI models and AI tools around the corner I know which ones are doing well and which ones are about to close large funding rounds I know which ones are doing badly because I hear it in the offline world right the companies investors I'll speak to it's it's just access to know what is working and what's not really working so I know the companies where they've closed the last funding ground but will be announced 6 months later it's so valuable to have this information before anybody else because we build on top of models right so it's so important to know what's working what can we catch 6 months later 8 months later as the underlying model gets better what we did with Avatar in some senses right so I keep sharing all of this on my YouTube so definitely do subscribe this is the same as when I entered Google deep Min getting access to information which is not out on the internet lowers your risk profile when trying new things so the parent company AOS literally our only job is to build distribution and keep trying experiments right and then we pass it on to a subsidiary as it gets big enough so all of this is very useful for us because it lowers my risk profile of trying new things well that's it I like Davos from the world economic Forum it's not some Illuminati something something going on where some crazy parties and you know people controlling everything it's not really that I thought it was fun I learned a lot seeing behind the curtain seeing backstage I think was really cool and I'll keep sharing more of these insights with you anyway until next time bye,

KNu2i6P44MI,This Hologram Tech is Transforming How We See,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNu2i6P44MI,"This technology from Star Wars just became real. For almost a decade, holograms have been a marketing gimmick. But what this Tokyo based startup Polalgraph has built feels like a portal to another world. Let me explain. So the core idea behind what Portal has done is that if you can track a person's head in 3D space, you can also track their eyes and render the scene from each point of view. Merge these two POVs together and the screen becomes a window almost like a portal. One you can peer around, lean into or walk past. You just put on a pair of lightweight LCD shutter glasses, while a Vive tracker or a webcam tracks your head. Then a 3D projector or monitor shows you two slightly different images, one for each eye, sync to your exact head position. The result, realtime motion parallax and depth. Lean left and you see behind the virtual object. Crouch and you're looking under it. Recently, they also showed off their flagship demo called Geoportal. It almost looks like a sand table, but what's projected onto it is a full-blown 3D miniature city. Now, with the speed technologies moving, I don't think we're far away from actually stepping inside virtual cities or maybe even playing Age of Empires on the table against our",This technology from Star Wars just became real For almost a decade holograms have been a marketing gimmick But what this Tokyo based startup Polalgraph has built feels like a portal to another world Let me explain So the core idea behind what Portal has done is that if you can track a person's head in 3D space you can also track their eyes and render the scene from each point of view Merge these two POVs together and the screen becomes a window almost like a portal One you can peer around lean into or walk past You just put on a pair of lightweight LCD shutter glasses while a Vive tracker or a webcam tracks your head Then a 3D projector or monitor shows you two slightly different images one for each eye sync to your exact head position The result realtime motion parallax and depth Lean left and you see behind the virtual object Crouch and you're looking under it Recently they also showed off their flagship demo called Geoportal It almost looks like a sand table but what's projected onto it is a full-blown 3D miniature city Now with the speed technologies moving I don't think we're far away from actually stepping inside virtual cities or maybe even playing Age of Empires on the table against our,
O_1ljm8YHY8,How Adobe Built a $200B Brand (Every Brand Manager Must Watch),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_1ljm8YHY8,"Photoshop, right? The flagship has been around for so long. We wouldn't be able to exist without Photoshop. We do so much creative work today. What's the secret behind the longevity? You build products for yourselves. And you know, I think if you have a creative community and a DNA within the company, I think in many ways, you know, the most the sternest critics are yourselves. How does one get into the position of being CEO of Adobe? I was the last man standing. What is the career path to be where you're at? You know, what has that journey been like for you personally? If I go back really a long way around, I wanted to be a journalist growing up. I did not want to be CEO. I just wanted to build great products. I saw that you had recently said that in India, creativity might be the next IT boom. I want to know more about your thesis on on the creativity versus IT piece. We have the saying at Adobe where everybody has a story to tell. How do you not piss off like an entire legion of artists by going overly generative, but also how do you continue to stay relevant? Because if you don't do that, somebody else will counter position and say, ""Well, we're the generative only suite."" If you use the Firefly models, we said we're the company that has to respect and champion the intellectual property rights of the creative professionals. When when did you know you were going to be CEO? Like what was that moment like? Well, you know, I ladies and gentlemen, I am with the Adobe Global Chair and CEO, Shantanu Narayan. Shantu, it's an absolute honor to do this. It's uh kind of been, you know, I've been using Adobe tools since since before I knew what I was doing in life, right? One of the first exposures to an Adobe tool I had was maybe CS5 or CS6. And at that time, you know, if you wanted to make a website, you'd have to use the slicing tool. You'd have to have an image. You have to slice it up. And since then, you know, the standards have changed. Since then, the ways you make a website have changed. The ways you do design have changed. Tools have come. tools have gone. I would have bet a lot because I was very bullish on, you know, on on the internet when I was very young. I would I was very bullish on the idea that at some point there will be somebody that comes and does what Adobe does in the cloud and does that better. But somehow Photoshop, right, the flagship has been around for so long. And before I get into anything, I just want to know the secret of this longevity, right? We wouldn't be able to exist without Photoshop. We do so much creative work today. What's the secret behind the longevity? Well, first Vun, it's a pleasure to be on your show and thank you for being a creative. Uh, it's always fun to hear stories about people whose lives have changed as a result of pursuing creative endeavors, something that, as you can imagine, we have a tremendous passion for. I think as it relates to, you know, building products, uh, you know, I think there are a couple of lessons I've learned. The first is you build products for yourselves. And you know I think if you have a creative community and a DNA within the company I think in many ways uh you know the most the sternest critics are yourselves and so we're I think always trying to say you know uh how do we build products that you know delight us and uh become more affordable accessible uh uh but you're being kind also I mean you know I think as all good companies we're probably more self-critical of the things that we haven't done right. Uh we've certainly done some things right and um you know it's just it's a constant endeavor. And do you feel like working on desktop apps because I've heard from a lot of people right working on desktops apps especially in this era it's pretty difficult because you're working with something that's legacy that's been built a long time ago. You're probably rebuilding parts of it as you go. Is it harder to do than let's say building something in the cloud if you're doing it from scratch? Well, we don't think of it as desktop apps and cloud or mobile. I mean I think we think of it a lot more as surfaces and you know when uh all of these tectonic technology shifts happen you know I when the move uh to a mobile device happened you know one of the assertions we made was mobile devices shouldn't just be consumption devices they should be creation devices when we saw the cloud we looked at it and said why should you be tethered to a computer inspiration strikes at many uh times and so you should do it So I you know I I think we uh are constantly thinking about what surface provides what value and are you taking advantage of the surface. Uh many times I think you unfortunately try to uh retrofit what works well in one surface and another surface and you fail and so you know I I I think we tend to think of it as the web affords frictionfree usage of technology. mobile allows you, you know, a different kind of a screen factor and and ease of use and and speed at doing things. Uh, but the desktop, I think, has continued and the PC, frankly, has continued to be the place where most people would say they're the most productive and they're the most efficient. And so, take advantage of all the surfaces because at the end of the day, that allows us to target and deal with more customers. No, that makes sense. Um, Chanta, I want to know how does one get into the position of being CEO of Adobe? Like what is it? What I was the last man standing? What is the career path to be where you're at? And you know, what has that journey been like for you personally? You know, I if I go back really a long way, Vun, I wanted to be a journalist growing up. Um you know I I was always fascinated by writing and um the first ever job which as you know uh at least in the 80s when I grew up in India um you didn't really have summer jobs and you didn't have internships but um I apprenticed at you know a newspaper doing copywriting. So you know journalism was always important to me. Um and now vicariously I'm still part of the publishing industry but um my professional journey I I've worked for all companies that I think have a creative DNA in them. I was at Apple for many years when Jurassic Park came out. I worked for Silicon Graphics. I started my own company. So like you I'm an entrepreneur. Uh unlike you, I was a failed entrepreneur at what I did. Uh a company I think everyone goes through enough like a bunch of failures before it works. uh a company called Pictra. I say the best thing that happened to me because that brought me to Adobe and Pictures on the web. U you know in the early '9s I felt like that social connection would be important. And then I came to Adobe because I looked at it and I said, ""Oh my god, look at the franchise that Adobe had."" And Adobe was actually uh in conversations to potentially acquire picture. The deal didn't happen. And I said, you know, when I think about the brand of Photoshop and the brand of Illustrator and Acrobat, it was something that really resonated with me and um I was lucky enough uh to be recruited there. You know, my journey at Adobe changed dramatically over the years. Uh but the core genesis I think was that I'm you know maybe at my core I care about design. I care about creativity. I care about expression and you know Adobe is the ultimate privilege to be able to work for it. I did not want to be CEO when I came. It wasn't you know there are some people who are early enough in their life they know I want to be this particular role. I just wanted to build great products. You know what was your role like entering the company? I was called a VPG GM uh you know of uh one of the groups. I mean you mentioned that you're spending more time doing P&Ls. You know, everybody tends to think that being a GM, you know, you've sort of arrived. Uh, but funnily, I joined as a GM. The company hit a wall uh 6 months later and we laid off uh something like 25% of the company. This was in 1998 and u they then asked me to actually take over inesign. Inesign was this naent project. They said, ""Hey, you're a technologist."" They completely reorganized to be functional. So I was no longer a general manager. I was an engineering uh lead for the layout products. Um and then 6 months later I think you know we shipped in design in design luckily one and then they asked me to run all engineering. So you know the path uh and career paths and I think even for your listeners they take different routes but I think uh if you can always think about where you add value and the value that needed to be added at that point was getting in design out of the door and you know we're at our core a product company and so and being able to run all products was a privilege. When when did you know you were going to be CEO? Like what was that moment like? Well, you know, I as I said, I joined in 98. By 99, I was running all engineering. By 2001, I was promoted to run all products. And you know, at some point there along the way, you're like, ""Oh, oh my god, maybe, you know, I will have the opportunity to run the company."" And in 2005, I got promoted to be president and chief operating officer. And that felt more real at that point. But then we acquired macro media and you know the integration took a little while. Um but you know when the two founders uh who unfortunately have both passed you know both brilliant brilliant brilliant people John Waro and Chuck Gashki when they told me that the board had decided that I would be the next CEO. I mean professionally without a doubt um it was the most you know honor that I've received in my career and something that I cherish to this day. That's a crazy story. You know, in our own company now, we do thousands of videos a month. We never thought we'd get to this scale, right? And generative has really been the backbone. Everything from avatars to just the micro advantages you get from using generative, right? It could be as simple as generative fill. Extend the frame, right? It's just so many small things that have really made our life easier. We do content for 10 of our own channels, 40 client channels. Um and you know it's almost like in India for content we've kind of become the port of first call but we never imagined such a large opportunity to be there here right and we can see now that there's no end to where the opportunity is right and I saw that you had recently said that in India creativity might be the next IT boom right I've started to believe it but it's very hard to get the average person to believe this right because they're like well it has been around for a very very long time and creativity well it still feels like India would be you know India's not there on the global stage yet but I think generative really fills that gap. Uh I want to know more about your thesis on on on the creativity versus IT piece. Well, you know it's I think it's true across so many dimensions, right? I mean the first thing is you know we have this saying at Adobe where everybody has a story to tell and so if you think about the fact that everybody has a story to tell and they want to tell their story at the end of the day that's in a way your addressable market for the world, right? Um if you think about education and why is it in this day and age that education is still about writing rather than you know animating or having videos or uh you know being able to express yourself graphically. Um when you think about any commerce business right now a commerce business is basically about an experience and the person who creates the best experience is going to be the one that wins. So you know if you decompose what creativity really means uh as a part of every industry right uh as well as this fundamental social need I mean why have the social networks really exploded it's because people fundamentally have a need to interact in a way that's unique and personal to them. So that's why I'm a big believer that at the end of the day, creativity is uh you know one of those fundamental uh social desires that are going that are going to create massive markets. Now how you decide what component of each of these other businesses is as a result of creativity versus is commerce really creativity? I tend to think it is right and it plays a role. uh but that so I think it's the lens by which we approach it allows us as a company to then think about oh my god if we have this big opportunity are we capitalizing on the opportunity I think in many ways when companies scale it's not that they suddenly wake up one morning and you know the market has grown it's you're changing the aperture by which you look at the opportunity I mean when you were talking about it you know whether it's the channel that you run versus a channel for a company versus a channel. So I I think that's how we're trying to expand you know how we think about creativity. And you know when I went to Waves and you you gave a keynote at Waves as well, right? Like if you the minute you landed in Mumbai to the point where you were at the event, it was plastered with like billboards on Waves and audio video communication. It if if I was Adobe I would be like dancing, right? I would be like great like everyone's woken up. I was so surprised to see a the spends b the kind of you know time energy and attention that the government is now giving you know things like creativity I think they're very bullish that this could be the next you know sort of it-esque industry u do you have a sense of how many more jobs could be created here maybe not tangible numbers but just you know what how you see this volume expand is it a training thing is it a you know if you were to architect this how would you do it well I think first it it starts with education and it starts with accessibility I you know the story that's often told about how somebody left a computer you know unattended in a small village in India and how you know people just embrace it. So I I think the first thing is accessible and I think with mobile devices and PCs it's just going to become more accessible which I think is great uh because when you have accessibility you know I I think you foster opportunity u I think the second thing is uh you know inspiration. So if you have accessibility, you want to be inspired, right? And I think if there are two things that inspire people in this country, at least maybe there's a little bit of a, you know, cliche, but it's sports and cricket and it's films, right? And both of them are, you know, are inherently also experiences that you do. And so I don't know that I have a number. I know it's big. I mean, we have aspirations to even in the education market, you know, find two crores of people. And how do you it used to be reading, writing, and arithmetic when I grew up were the three skills that people said were the way to improve your lot. Why isn't it reading, writing, arithmetic, and digital literacy with creativity a fundamental part of that? So if you think about it that way, then every single student with this skill now has an opportunity if you're a small and be small business, if you're a person working in the creative. So I I think it's unlimited. Now how much of that then translates into economic you know GDP and the growth associated with that? I think that's work ahead of us. But I what I was really impressed with what the government was doing was to say hey this is just one of those fundamental things that if we do right you know we're going to foster a new generation. I know they've always been enamored with the animation industry and the graphics industry. The publishing industry still in India is probably the most lucrative publishing industry in the world. Right. And so I I but I think it solves these fundamental issues of education, of opportunity. And so I I think it's immense. Yeah. Um I have a question around generative AI and this is a I often say that somebody's asking me this the other day and I and I said that it's kind of a tough spot to be in Adobe's like shoes right now mainly because there's two clear audiences here, right? Or or maybe that's the general subset of two audiences. one who will adopt everything that everything new in generative AI they want it they want to speed up their workflows they probably have a lot of work on their plate and they want to move forward there's also a group of creatives that is a little bit anti-generative right and there is a line that they draw which is well generative fill is fine but if you're using you know um you know something which is completely AI generated that's a problem right so it is it's hard because you can't end up building two product suites right one with generative one without generative Um, so how do you see this? Like how do you not piss off like an entire legion of artists by going overly generative, but also how do you continue to stay relevant? Because if you don't do that, somebody else will counterposition and say, well, we're the generative only suite. I I actually think Adobe has done a phenomenal job of addressing that upfront. And part of what we talk about as a company is it's not just the technology, but it's the responsibility that we have as one of the larger companies in the space to speak on behalf of the community. So I I'll geek out for a little while. First, as it relates to our models and the models that we've created, as you know, we were the company that said we're only going to create these models based on licensed content. Very unique, very differentiated. And so if you use the Firefly models, we said we're the company that has to respect and champion the rights, the intellectual property rights of the creative professionals, which is why we do it. You know, we have Behance, as you know, it's one of the largest, if not the largest creative professional network in the world, but we did not train on that because we didn't have rights to do that. So, first we made a very strong uh, you know, statement of what we thought about intellectual property. Now, I think that appealed to the community because the community said if there's one company that's speaking up for the rights of and I think the courts will eventually have to appine on some of this stuff, but we make that stance and we actually have stuck by it. Um, I think there's so how do we think about it in terms of product strategy? To your point, we have such a wide variety of customers. consumers who want to use a product like Adobe Express, they probably don't need the flexibility of multiple models. So, they're just like, I fear the blank page. The real beauty or the benefit of generative AI is that most people when they have something that they want to create, they fear the blank page. Whereas being able to have a conversation and have that process kicked off either with a template or with a conversation enables them to, you know, uh, be more productive. So I think for that community, we've built in Firefly, we will have Express, but the fact that it's commercially safe. The consumer probably cares a little bit less about what's underlying the technology, they just want to get stuff done. The creative professional on the other hand, as you know, we started off with for generative fill or generative extend, we only had Firefly support because we were convinced that that was the right way to serve the creative community. With enterprises, you know, the largest enterprises in the world are partnering with us because they don't want their content ingested by people who don't respect intellectual property. So, we've created custom models for them. So now we also have this flexibility where if you're within Coke, you're creating a marketing campaign, you have a custom model of Firefly that has all your assets as well as Adobe's Firefly because that's also, you know, designed to be commercially safe. It's the Firefly model fine-tuned on their internal app. Exactly. Um and you do that as a service or is that Yeah, we do that as a service you know uh and the interest in that as you can imagine is immense because you know your intellectual property is your data. They don't want their data you know scraped on the internet and so that's why they do that. However, you also if you think about where creatives are using it right now, creatives have also embraced this idea of when I'm ideulating, maybe I'm okay using, you know, a model that's not designed to be commercially safe. But then later when I use it in production, I want to make sure that I use it because that's like going to an art gallery and getting inspired by a painting on the wall, you know, to to do some creative. And so at the recent Max conference we showed how you know we will support thirdparty models and that's actually come as a result of uh you know customers saying we love Adobe products support the third party model and we will differentiate between when we're using it for ideiation versus when we're using it to be uh used in production. As you know also and again I'm geeking out but in the Photoshop when you upload a picture and you say hallucinate with not just the text but in the spirit of this picture we actually ask you to testify that you have rights to that picture. So you know it's this balance that we're trying to do. We want to give flexibility. We want to serve the customers in the diverse ways in which they want to but we also want to make it clear what our northstar is of what we stand for which is you know how we stand for the intellectual property how we stand for content authenticity. We're thrilled. We have 4,000 people who've signed up to, you know, uh, be part of this content authenticity initiative where you, uh, will specify the provenence, but it's work in progress. And I think, you know, we're also a company that's smart enough to say this thing will evolve and if we don't evolve with the times, we won't be serving our customers and our prospective customers. Well, I have a a CEO question to you, right? Um so when I started a company when I started this company actually we started with creativity then we said you know we'll infuse technology in here to get scale which I think has worked out well but now I find I spend most of my time like I said you know pre this chat I spend most of my time on P&L managing people figuring out how to hire people I want to know from a time management perspective right how do you actually manage your time like what do you spend most of your time on what is top priority for you what are the messages on your on your phone that you need to like like how would you say your your time management and day management framework is? How much how much time do you spend on hiring? Like I want to know everything like and you can go you can geek out as much as you want. Well, the reality is you know what you focus on changes. You know I I I'll share with you what one of the co-founders John Waro told me when I took my job. when I first took my job, he said, ""If I don't like my job, I have one person to blame."" And in many ways, that was the most profound piece of advice that he gave me. And so, bro, what I'll tell you is you have more power to spend the time on whatever you want to spend the time on. And you know one of the things we try and do as a senior executive team every year at the beginning of the year is we say what are the two or three things that you want to do that you think will really move the needle or have impact in the company and then disproportionately spend time on that uh your demands whether they be IR investors or you know PR or whether it's product or whether it's customers it could be infinite and you know time is your most valuable commodity. So I'm actually quite thoughtful about where I am going to spend my time and where I'm not going to spend my time. And the power of a team is that you can get somebody else to do the stuff that you're either not very good at or you don't have an inclination to do. So but it changes. One year I might say I want to spend time on industry partnerships and I'm going to invest my time and energy on that. But I have that conversation with my team so that somebody else is picking up the stuff that perhaps I'm not going to be spending time on and then you trust your team to you know do the other stuff. So I that that's the advice that I would give but it changes. The one constant I would say in my job is product. At the end of the day we're a product company. If you don't build innovative great products and in many ways my role is chief product officer as well right when you're running a tech company you should be that. And so that's the constant. But otherwise I flip it around. I flip it around because I want to have fun doing the things that I want to do and and I you know dirty secret for both of us. We have the luxury of doing that. Can I ask you a question on how you communicate with your team? Do you are you very verbal about it? Do you do you do meetings or are you like I'm going to write a note and do you spend a lot of time writing those notes? Like what's your feed like how do you how do you communicate with them? You know, my philosophy on the team, we have pretty regular check-ins every Monday. So, a Monday is sort of And how big is that exactly? Six, seven people. I mean, that's the thing when people also say, ""Oh my god, you run this large company."" The liberating fact is you still have the same number of people whether the company is, you know, 5 million or the company is 5,000 or the company is 50. And, you know, it's the power of that team that helps you manage and scale and grow the company. I like email because I think it forces me to be more precise and I also find that you know when when you have a conversation with people people interpret different things and so I I I've always liked the discipline of writing it but only for important things right I mean if you have a product strategy issue or if you have something that you think the company is not doing well then I think taking the trouble to actually write it pays off in spades but otherwise you know we have meetings it's a very open flow we call it roundt and the roundt idea is whatever's top of mind I mean in many ways I also m view my role as removing obstacles and so I have my agenda of the things I'm probably interested in but I have to spend as much time on the things that people are interested in either getting my opinion either make helping them make a decision or you know just having that cross in many ways it's the cross team conversations that you have to spend time on in your role because you're they don't communicate as as well. No or they do it in silos. No, it's not the silos. It's more like that's your role. I mean, what's your role? You are consolidating across the different functions. So, I it's it's not about them. It's about you, right? And if you're playing that role of assimilating between product and marketing or legal and finance, uh I I just view that as that's my role. And so I think one of the best parts about me creating content and I tell this to people is that I just get access to people like you and it just helps me become a better entrepreneur because I'm just like I have this I have these questions and now I have the best in the world to kind of ask them and you know figure it out. What does the Adobe India team do? Like the team here that I see right there about 3,000 people in this campus. what is Adobe India's focus you know um when we first started the campus and this was you know probably six months before I joined the company um Nares Gupta who started the company had this vision of he wanted to just create the best hire the best and build innovative products and not do stuff that would be perceived as you know maintenance or grant work and that stayed true to I mean part of what strategy is if you can't articulate the strategy in a few words it's probably too complicated so we've always believed in Adobe India I mean apart from the sales because you know India is a big market but if your question was around what does the product team do it's all about product innovation and therefore they're involved in every major product in fact we run an entire business Abigan Modi who runs the India office right now he runs the global business for acrobat and PDF F and so you know I time is not really and time and location is not how you run stuff and so uh but we do fundamental stuff from you know I think we file the number of patents that are filed from this place has always been off the charts but it started with this germ of an idea of you know hire absolutely the best and create a differentiated product group that believes that their job is building innovative products and ownership and you know when people feel ownership then you're not holding them accountable. They're holding themselves accountable. And I it's it's thrived because of that core sort of way in which the company was formed. I have one last question for you. I think you've been generous with your time. I have one last question. My wife actually runs a video editing school and she said one of the biggest requests they had was, you know, a youngster who is for the first time getting into some of the Adobe tools, especially in India. There's been this request of there needs to be a lowcost easy way for them to get in and you know they will be the biggest champions and influencers of Adobe inside the augs once they get placed because the school also has a lot of placements. Do you have a plan for to do to ever do a lower cost easier way to get in sort of product for you know premier pro at least? Well there are two ways I would you know interpret the question. The first is we want to make sure these products are easily the on-ramp to the products. We want them to be as simple as possible. And so I I think again the fact that we have the spectrum from mobile apps to web-based apps to uh desktop apps, we have actually made them way more uh you know accessible. The second thing is uh educational pricing and you know finding ways to have educational pricing. Not enough people know about that actually and we should market that better and we should market that better and uh but you know clearly I I think this is an area that we need to do more. I think we've done a lot of great stuff but making it affordable and accessible because you're absolutely right. I mean the folks that your wife is you know training are going to be the next generation creatives and the more they are and the more they love Adobe software when they enter the professional world. I mean the irony is that also happened in many ways when you know piracy was rampant in many countries but when we moved to the cloud we were incredibly surprised by how people were fundamentally wanting to do the right thing you know for the value that we're getting and it got cheaper and so that's a constant refrain I think the mobile apps will be you know we have premium mo mobile apps so you know you can do a lot of that functionality but we will also follow up with your wife's uh video editing uh school to understand how we can serve them better. Awesome. Thank you so much, Shantu. This was amazing. I learned so much. I hopefully become a better, you know, founder after this. And this is so enlightening. Thank you so much. It's my pleasure. Thanks for having me. Likewise.","Photoshop right The flagship has been around for so long We wouldn't be able to exist without Photoshop We do so much creative work today What's the secret behind the longevity You build products for yourselves And you know I think if you have a creative community and a DNA within the company I think in many ways you know the most the sternest critics are yourselves How does one get into the position of being CEO of Adobe I was the last man standing What is the career path to be where you're at You know what has that journey been like for you personally If I go back really a long way around I wanted to be a journalist growing up I did not want to be CEO I just wanted to build great products I saw that you had recently said that in India creativity might be the next IT boom I want to know more about your thesis on on the creativity versus IT piece We have the saying at Adobe where everybody has a story to tell How do you not piss off like an entire legion of artists by going overly generative but also how do you continue to stay relevant Because if you don't do that somebody else will counter position and say ""Well we're the generative only suite"" If you use the Firefly models we said we're the company that has to respect and champion the intellectual property rights of the creative professionals When when did you know you were going to be CEO Like what was that moment like Well you know I ladies and gentlemen I am with the Adobe Global Chair and CEO Shantanu Narayan Shantu it's an absolute honor to do this It's uh kind of been you know I've been using Adobe tools since since before I knew what I was doing in life right One of the first exposures to an Adobe tool I had was maybe CS5 or CS6 And at that time you know if you wanted to make a website you'd have to use the slicing tool You'd have to have an image You have to slice it up And since then you know the standards have changed Since then the ways you make a website have changed The ways you do design have changed Tools have come tools have gone I would have bet a lot because I was very bullish on you know on on the internet when I was very young I would I was very bullish on the idea that at some point there will be somebody that comes and does what Adobe does in the cloud and does that better But somehow Photoshop right the flagship has been around for so long And before I get into anything I just want to know the secret of this longevity right We wouldn't be able to exist without Photoshop We do so much creative work today What's the secret behind the longevity Well first Vun it's a pleasure to be on your show and thank you for being a creative Uh it's always fun to hear stories about people whose lives have changed as a result of pursuing creative endeavors something that as you can imagine we have a tremendous passion for I think as it relates to you know building products uh you know I think there are a couple of lessons I've learned The first is you build products for yourselves And you know I think if you have a creative community and a DNA within the company I think in many ways uh you know the most the sternest critics are yourselves and so we're I think always trying to say you know uh how do we build products that you know delight us and uh become more affordable accessible uh uh but you're being kind also I mean you know I think as all good companies we're probably more self-critical of the things that we haven't done right Uh we've certainly done some things right and um you know it's just it's a constant endeavor And do you feel like working on desktop apps because I've heard from a lot of people right working on desktops apps especially in this era it's pretty difficult because you're working with something that's legacy that's been built a long time ago You're probably rebuilding parts of it as you go Is it harder to do than let's say building something in the cloud if you're doing it from scratch Well we don't think of it as desktop apps and cloud or mobile I mean I think we think of it a lot more as surfaces and you know when uh all of these tectonic technology shifts happen you know I when the move uh to a mobile device happened you know one of the assertions we made was mobile devices shouldn't just be consumption devices they should be creation devices when we saw the cloud we looked at it and said why should you be tethered to a computer inspiration strikes at many uh times and so you should do it So I you know I I think we uh are constantly thinking about what surface provides what value and are you taking advantage of the surface Uh many times I think you unfortunately try to uh retrofit what works well in one surface and another surface and you fail and so you know I I I think we tend to think of it as the web affords frictionfree usage of technology mobile allows you you know a different kind of a screen factor and and ease of use and and speed at doing things Uh but the desktop I think has continued and the PC frankly has continued to be the place where most people would say they're the most productive and they're the most efficient And so take advantage of all the surfaces because at the end of the day that allows us to target and deal with more customers No that makes sense Um Chanta I want to know how does one get into the position of being CEO of Adobe Like what is it What I was the last man standing What is the career path to be where you're at And you know what has that journey been like for you personally You know I if I go back really a long way Vun I wanted to be a journalist growing up Um you know I I was always fascinated by writing and um the first ever job which as you know uh at least in the 80s when I grew up in India um you didn't really have summer jobs and you didn't have internships but um I apprenticed at you know a newspaper doing copywriting So you know journalism was always important to me Um and now vicariously I'm still part of the publishing industry but um my professional journey I I've worked for all companies that I think have a creative DNA in them I was at Apple for many years when Jurassic Park came out I worked for Silicon Graphics I started my own company So like you I'm an entrepreneur Uh unlike you I was a failed entrepreneur at what I did Uh a company I think everyone goes through enough like a bunch of failures before it works uh a company called Pictra I say the best thing that happened to me because that brought me to Adobe and Pictures on the web U you know in the early '9s I felt like that social connection would be important And then I came to Adobe because I looked at it and I said ""Oh my god look at the franchise that Adobe had"" And Adobe was actually uh in conversations to potentially acquire picture The deal didn't happen And I said you know when I think about the brand of Photoshop and the brand of Illustrator and Acrobat it was something that really resonated with me and um I was lucky enough uh to be recruited there You know my journey at Adobe changed dramatically over the years Uh but the core genesis I think was that I'm you know maybe at my core I care about design I care about creativity I care about expression and you know Adobe is the ultimate privilege to be able to work for it I did not want to be CEO when I came It wasn't you know there are some people who are early enough in their life they know I want to be this particular role I just wanted to build great products You know what was your role like entering the company I was called a VPG GM uh you know of uh one of the groups I mean you mentioned that you're spending more time doing P&Ls You know everybody tends to think that being a GM you know you've sort of arrived Uh but funnily I joined as a GM The company hit a wall uh 6 months later and we laid off uh something like 25% of the company This was in 1998 and u they then asked me to actually take over inesign Inesign was this naent project They said ""Hey you're a technologist"" They completely reorganized to be functional So I was no longer a general manager I was an engineering uh lead for the layout products Um and then 6 months later I think you know we shipped in design in design luckily one and then they asked me to run all engineering So you know the path uh and career paths and I think even for your listeners they take different routes but I think uh if you can always think about where you add value and the value that needed to be added at that point was getting in design out of the door and you know we're at our core a product company and so and being able to run all products was a privilege When when did you know you were going to be CEO Like what was that moment like Well you know I as I said I joined in 98 By 99 I was running all engineering By 2001 I was promoted to run all products And you know at some point there along the way you're like ""Oh oh my god maybe you know I will have the opportunity to run the company"" And in 2005 I got promoted to be president and chief operating officer And that felt more real at that point But then we acquired macro media and you know the integration took a little while Um but you know when the two founders uh who unfortunately have both passed you know both brilliant brilliant brilliant people John Waro and Chuck Gashki when they told me that the board had decided that I would be the next CEO I mean professionally without a doubt um it was the most you know honor that I've received in my career and something that I cherish to this day That's a crazy story You know in our own company now we do thousands of videos a month We never thought we'd get to this scale right And generative has really been the backbone Everything from avatars to just the micro advantages you get from using generative right It could be as simple as generative fill Extend the frame right It's just so many small things that have really made our life easier We do content for 10 of our own channels 40 client channels Um and you know it's almost like in India for content we've kind of become the port of first call but we never imagined such a large opportunity to be there here right and we can see now that there's no end to where the opportunity is right and I saw that you had recently said that in India creativity might be the next IT boom right I've started to believe it but it's very hard to get the average person to believe this right because they're like well it has been around for a very very long time and creativity well it still feels like India would be you know India's not there on the global stage yet but I think generative really fills that gap Uh I want to know more about your thesis on on on the creativity versus IT piece Well you know it's I think it's true across so many dimensions right I mean the first thing is you know we have this saying at Adobe where everybody has a story to tell and so if you think about the fact that everybody has a story to tell and they want to tell their story at the end of the day that's in a way your addressable market for the world right Um if you think about education and why is it in this day and age that education is still about writing rather than you know animating or having videos or uh you know being able to express yourself graphically Um when you think about any commerce business right now a commerce business is basically about an experience and the person who creates the best experience is going to be the one that wins So you know if you decompose what creativity really means uh as a part of every industry right uh as well as this fundamental social need I mean why have the social networks really exploded it's because people fundamentally have a need to interact in a way that's unique and personal to them So that's why I'm a big believer that at the end of the day creativity is uh you know one of those fundamental uh social desires that are going that are going to create massive markets Now how you decide what component of each of these other businesses is as a result of creativity versus is commerce really creativity I tend to think it is right and it plays a role uh but that so I think it's the lens by which we approach it allows us as a company to then think about oh my god if we have this big opportunity are we capitalizing on the opportunity I think in many ways when companies scale it's not that they suddenly wake up one morning and you know the market has grown it's you're changing the aperture by which you look at the opportunity I mean when you were talking about it you know whether it's the channel that you run versus a channel for a company versus a channel So I I think that's how we're trying to expand you know how we think about creativity And you know when I went to Waves and you you gave a keynote at Waves as well right Like if you the minute you landed in Mumbai to the point where you were at the event it was plastered with like billboards on Waves and audio video communication It if if I was Adobe I would be like dancing right I would be like great like everyone's woken up I was so surprised to see a the spends b the kind of you know time energy and attention that the government is now giving you know things like creativity I think they're very bullish that this could be the next you know sort of it-esque industry u do you have a sense of how many more jobs could be created here maybe not tangible numbers but just you know what how you see this volume expand is it a training thing is it a you know if you were to architect this how would you do it well I think first it it starts with education and it starts with accessibility I you know the story that's often told about how somebody left a computer you know unattended in a small village in India and how you know people just embrace it So I I think the first thing is accessible and I think with mobile devices and PCs it's just going to become more accessible which I think is great uh because when you have accessibility you know I I think you foster opportunity u I think the second thing is uh you know inspiration So if you have accessibility you want to be inspired right And I think if there are two things that inspire people in this country at least maybe there's a little bit of a you know cliche but it's sports and cricket and it's films right And both of them are you know are inherently also experiences that you do And so I don't know that I have a number I know it's big I mean we have aspirations to even in the education market you know find two crores of people And how do you it used to be reading writing and arithmetic when I grew up were the three skills that people said were the way to improve your lot Why isn't it reading writing arithmetic and digital literacy with creativity a fundamental part of that So if you think about it that way then every single student with this skill now has an opportunity if you're a small and be small business if you're a person working in the creative So I I think it's unlimited Now how much of that then translates into economic you know GDP and the growth associated with that I think that's work ahead of us But I what I was really impressed with what the government was doing was to say hey this is just one of those fundamental things that if we do right you know we're going to foster a new generation I know they've always been enamored with the animation industry and the graphics industry The publishing industry still in India is probably the most lucrative publishing industry in the world Right And so I I but I think it solves these fundamental issues of education of opportunity And so I I think it's immense Yeah Um I have a question around generative AI and this is a I often say that somebody's asking me this the other day and I and I said that it's kind of a tough spot to be in Adobe's like shoes right now mainly because there's two clear audiences here right Or or maybe that's the general subset of two audiences one who will adopt everything that everything new in generative AI they want it they want to speed up their workflows they probably have a lot of work on their plate and they want to move forward there's also a group of creatives that is a little bit anti-generative right and there is a line that they draw which is well generative fill is fine but if you're using you know um you know something which is completely AI generated that's a problem right so it is it's hard because you can't end up building two product suites right one with generative one without generative Um so how do you see this Like how do you not piss off like an entire legion of artists by going overly generative but also how do you continue to stay relevant Because if you don't do that somebody else will counterposition and say well we're the generative only suite I I actually think Adobe has done a phenomenal job of addressing that upfront And part of what we talk about as a company is it's not just the technology but it's the responsibility that we have as one of the larger companies in the space to speak on behalf of the community So I I'll geek out for a little while First as it relates to our models and the models that we've created as you know we were the company that said we're only going to create these models based on licensed content Very unique very differentiated And so if you use the Firefly models we said we're the company that has to respect and champion the rights the intellectual property rights of the creative professionals which is why we do it You know we have Behance as you know it's one of the largest if not the largest creative professional network in the world but we did not train on that because we didn't have rights to do that So first we made a very strong uh you know statement of what we thought about intellectual property Now I think that appealed to the community because the community said if there's one company that's speaking up for the rights of and I think the courts will eventually have to appine on some of this stuff but we make that stance and we actually have stuck by it Um I think there's so how do we think about it in terms of product strategy To your point we have such a wide variety of customers consumers who want to use a product like Adobe Express they probably don't need the flexibility of multiple models So they're just like I fear the blank page The real beauty or the benefit of generative AI is that most people when they have something that they want to create they fear the blank page Whereas being able to have a conversation and have that process kicked off either with a template or with a conversation enables them to you know uh be more productive So I think for that community we've built in Firefly we will have Express but the fact that it's commercially safe The consumer probably cares a little bit less about what's underlying the technology they just want to get stuff done The creative professional on the other hand as you know we started off with for generative fill or generative extend we only had Firefly support because we were convinced that that was the right way to serve the creative community With enterprises you know the largest enterprises in the world are partnering with us because they don't want their content ingested by people who don't respect intellectual property So we've created custom models for them So now we also have this flexibility where if you're within Coke you're creating a marketing campaign you have a custom model of Firefly that has all your assets as well as Adobe's Firefly because that's also you know designed to be commercially safe It's the Firefly model fine-tuned on their internal app Exactly Um and you do that as a service or is that Yeah we do that as a service you know uh and the interest in that as you can imagine is immense because you know your intellectual property is your data They don't want their data you know scraped on the internet and so that's why they do that However you also if you think about where creatives are using it right now creatives have also embraced this idea of when I'm ideulating maybe I'm okay using you know a model that's not designed to be commercially safe But then later when I use it in production I want to make sure that I use it because that's like going to an art gallery and getting inspired by a painting on the wall you know to to do some creative And so at the recent Max conference we showed how you know we will support thirdparty models and that's actually come as a result of uh you know customers saying we love Adobe products support the third party model and we will differentiate between when we're using it for ideiation versus when we're using it to be uh used in production As you know also and again I'm geeking out but in the Photoshop when you upload a picture and you say hallucinate with not just the text but in the spirit of this picture we actually ask you to testify that you have rights to that picture So you know it's this balance that we're trying to do We want to give flexibility We want to serve the customers in the diverse ways in which they want to but we also want to make it clear what our northstar is of what we stand for which is you know how we stand for the intellectual property how we stand for content authenticity We're thrilled We have 4000 people who've signed up to you know uh be part of this content authenticity initiative where you uh will specify the provenence but it's work in progress And I think you know we're also a company that's smart enough to say this thing will evolve and if we don't evolve with the times we won't be serving our customers and our prospective customers Well I have a a CEO question to you right Um so when I started a company when I started this company actually we started with creativity then we said you know we'll infuse technology in here to get scale which I think has worked out well but now I find I spend most of my time like I said you know pre this chat I spend most of my time on P&L managing people figuring out how to hire people I want to know from a time management perspective right how do you actually manage your time like what do you spend most of your time on what is top priority for you what are the messages on your on your phone that you need to like like how would you say your your time management and day management framework is How much how much time do you spend on hiring Like I want to know everything like and you can go you can geek out as much as you want Well the reality is you know what you focus on changes You know I I I'll share with you what one of the co-founders John Waro told me when I took my job when I first took my job he said ""If I don't like my job I have one person to blame"" And in many ways that was the most profound piece of advice that he gave me And so bro what I'll tell you is you have more power to spend the time on whatever you want to spend the time on And you know one of the things we try and do as a senior executive team every year at the beginning of the year is we say what are the two or three things that you want to do that you think will really move the needle or have impact in the company and then disproportionately spend time on that uh your demands whether they be IR investors or you know PR or whether it's product or whether it's customers it could be infinite and you know time is your most valuable commodity So I'm actually quite thoughtful about where I am going to spend my time and where I'm not going to spend my time And the power of a team is that you can get somebody else to do the stuff that you're either not very good at or you don't have an inclination to do So but it changes One year I might say I want to spend time on industry partnerships and I'm going to invest my time and energy on that But I have that conversation with my team so that somebody else is picking up the stuff that perhaps I'm not going to be spending time on and then you trust your team to you know do the other stuff So I that that's the advice that I would give but it changes The one constant I would say in my job is product At the end of the day we're a product company If you don't build innovative great products and in many ways my role is chief product officer as well right when you're running a tech company you should be that And so that's the constant But otherwise I flip it around I flip it around because I want to have fun doing the things that I want to do and and I you know dirty secret for both of us We have the luxury of doing that Can I ask you a question on how you communicate with your team Do you are you very verbal about it Do you do you do meetings or are you like I'm going to write a note and do you spend a lot of time writing those notes Like what's your feed like how do you how do you communicate with them You know my philosophy on the team we have pretty regular check-ins every Monday So a Monday is sort of And how big is that exactly Six seven people I mean that's the thing when people also say ""Oh my god you run this large company"" The liberating fact is you still have the same number of people whether the company is you know 5 million or the company is 5000 or the company is 50 And you know it's the power of that team that helps you manage and scale and grow the company I like email because I think it forces me to be more precise and I also find that you know when when you have a conversation with people people interpret different things and so I I I've always liked the discipline of writing it but only for important things right I mean if you have a product strategy issue or if you have something that you think the company is not doing well then I think taking the trouble to actually write it pays off in spades but otherwise you know we have meetings it's a very open flow we call it roundt and the roundt idea is whatever's top of mind I mean in many ways I also m view my role as removing obstacles and so I have my agenda of the things I'm probably interested in but I have to spend as much time on the things that people are interested in either getting my opinion either make helping them make a decision or you know just having that cross in many ways it's the cross team conversations that you have to spend time on in your role because you're they don't communicate as as well No or they do it in silos No it's not the silos It's more like that's your role I mean what's your role You are consolidating across the different functions So I it's it's not about them It's about you right And if you're playing that role of assimilating between product and marketing or legal and finance uh I I just view that as that's my role And so I think one of the best parts about me creating content and I tell this to people is that I just get access to people like you and it just helps me become a better entrepreneur because I'm just like I have this I have these questions and now I have the best in the world to kind of ask them and you know figure it out What does the Adobe India team do Like the team here that I see right there about 3000 people in this campus what is Adobe India's focus you know um when we first started the campus and this was you know probably six months before I joined the company um Nares Gupta who started the company had this vision of he wanted to just create the best hire the best and build innovative products and not do stuff that would be perceived as you know maintenance or grant work and that stayed true to I mean part of what strategy is if you can't articulate the strategy in a few words it's probably too complicated so we've always believed in Adobe India I mean apart from the sales because you know India is a big market but if your question was around what does the product team do it's all about product innovation and therefore they're involved in every major product in fact we run an entire business Abigan Modi who runs the India office right now he runs the global business for acrobat and PDF F and so you know I time is not really and time and location is not how you run stuff and so uh but we do fundamental stuff from you know I think we file the number of patents that are filed from this place has always been off the charts but it started with this germ of an idea of you know hire absolutely the best and create a differentiated product group that believes that their job is building innovative products and ownership and you know when people feel ownership then you're not holding them accountable They're holding themselves accountable And I it's it's thrived because of that core sort of way in which the company was formed I have one last question for you I think you've been generous with your time I have one last question My wife actually runs a video editing school and she said one of the biggest requests they had was you know a youngster who is for the first time getting into some of the Adobe tools especially in India There's been this request of there needs to be a lowcost easy way for them to get in and you know they will be the biggest champions and influencers of Adobe inside the augs once they get placed because the school also has a lot of placements Do you have a plan for to do to ever do a lower cost easier way to get in sort of product for you know premier pro at least Well there are two ways I would you know interpret the question The first is we want to make sure these products are easily the on-ramp to the products We want them to be as simple as possible And so I I think again the fact that we have the spectrum from mobile apps to web-based apps to uh desktop apps we have actually made them way more uh you know accessible The second thing is uh educational pricing and you know finding ways to have educational pricing Not enough people know about that actually and we should market that better and we should market that better and uh but you know clearly I I think this is an area that we need to do more I think we've done a lot of great stuff but making it affordable and accessible because you're absolutely right I mean the folks that your wife is you know training are going to be the next generation creatives and the more they are and the more they love Adobe software when they enter the professional world I mean the irony is that also happened in many ways when you know piracy was rampant in many countries but when we moved to the cloud we were incredibly surprised by how people were fundamentally wanting to do the right thing you know for the value that we're getting and it got cheaper and so that's a constant refrain I think the mobile apps will be you know we have premium mo mobile apps so you know you can do a lot of that functionality but we will also follow up with your wife's uh video editing uh school to understand how we can serve them better Awesome Thank you so much Shantu This was amazing I learned so much I hopefully become a better you know founder after this And this is so enlightening Thank you so much It's my pleasure Thanks for having me Likewise",
q35kYNwA6tE,Quick Recap of Google IO 2025,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q35kYNwA6tE,"Ladies and gentlemen, we're at Google IO. Let's do a quick wrap. And I'm about to break down everything mind-blowing from the 2025 keynote in just a quick minute. Now, Google is going allin on AI that is more intelligent, agentic, and personalized than ever before. First, they're improving their most intelligent models. Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro are getting major upgrades. The standout is Deep Think, a new enhanced reasoning mode in Gemini 2.5 Pro that can tackle super complex math and coding tasks through parallel thinking. Next up, Gemini powered agents are next level this year. Project Mariner can now juggle up to 10 tasks at once, learns workflows after you teach it just once, and powers the new agent mode inside the Gemini app. Think finding apartments, booking tours, or handling forms automatically. Plus, what's really cool is you'll soon be able to shop with AI, including virtually trying on clothes from your own photos with just a single upload. They're also launching impressive generative media models. Imagine 4 creates stunning images with better text rendering. While V3 is the first video model with native audio generation, adding environmental sounds and even dialogue to videos. Now, Google is also introducing Flow, a new AI filmmaking tool designed specifically for their advanced models that helps storytellers create cinematic clips and scenes without complicated production. For developers, Jules is now available in public beta. It's an asynchronous coding agent that integrates directly with repositories and handles tasks on your behalf. Then we have Android XR which is bringing Gemini to glasses and headsets. These smart glasses come with cameras, microphones, and an optional inland lens display working with your phone to give you hands-free AI assistance. Google is partnering with Wobbby Parker and Gentle Monster to make stylish versions. Finally, let's not forget Beam, previously called Project Starline. This AI first 3D video communication platform creates remarkably lielike conversations with speech translation capabilities. You see, I was at Google IO again this time and got my hands on some of these tools and demos. Trust me, this isn't just incremental progress.",Ladies and gentlemen we're at Google IO Let's do a quick wrap And I'm about to break down everything mind-blowing from the 2025 keynote in just a quick minute Now Google is going allin on AI that is more intelligent agentic and personalized than ever before First they're improving their most intelligent models Gemini 25 Flash and Pro are getting major upgrades The standout is Deep Think a new enhanced reasoning mode in Gemini 25 Pro that can tackle super complex math and coding tasks through parallel thinking Next up Gemini powered agents are next level this year Project Mariner can now juggle up to 10 tasks at once learns workflows after you teach it just once and powers the new agent mode inside the Gemini app Think finding apartments booking tours or handling forms automatically Plus what's really cool is you'll soon be able to shop with AI including virtually trying on clothes from your own photos with just a single upload They're also launching impressive generative media models Imagine 4 creates stunning images with better text rendering While V3 is the first video model with native audio generation adding environmental sounds and even dialogue to videos Now Google is also introducing Flow a new AI filmmaking tool designed specifically for their advanced models that helps storytellers create cinematic clips and scenes without complicated production For developers Jules is now available in public beta It's an asynchronous coding agent that integrates directly with repositories and handles tasks on your behalf Then we have Android XR which is bringing Gemini to glasses and headsets These smart glasses come with cameras microphones and an optional inland lens display working with your phone to give you hands-free AI assistance Google is partnering with Wobbby Parker and Gentle Monster to make stylish versions Finally let's not forget Beam previously called Project Starline This AI first 3D video communication platform creates remarkably lielike conversations with speech translation capabilities You see I was at Google IO again this time and got my hands on some of these tools and demos Trust me this isn't just incremental progress,
3LSpWCmyHzs,Google Veo 3 Can Now Generate Native Audio and Cinematic Videos,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LSpWCmyHzs,"Google just announced V3 at IO and for the first time ever, a video generation model can create not just visuals, but native audio, too. [Music] They left behind a a ball today. It bounced higher than I can jump. What manner of magic is that? According to Google's announcement, across the board, V3 excels from text and image prompting to real world physics and accurate lip-s syncing. It understands your ideas well. You can tell a short story in your prompt and the model gives you back a clip that brings it to life. This understanding is what makes VO3 such a gamechanger for filmmakers. But speaking of filmmakers, Google also designed Flow as an AI filmmaking tool explicitly built for VO. Flow takes Vio's capabilities further, helping storytellers explore their ideas without bounds, and create cinematic clips and scenes for their stories. With Flow, you describe shots in natural language. Manage story elements in one place and weave everything into beautiful scenes. Flow also unlocks powerful features like camera controls that help you define precise camera movements, including rotations, dollies, and zooms. There's also outpainting that expands your frame turning your video from portrait to landscape and object add and remove which lets you modify scenes while maintaining natural interactions. All this tech is available now for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US and more countries will follow soon.

tzqnycMoldI,Why Freshers Are Struggling to Get Tech Jobs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzqnycMoldI,"Have you noticed it's gotten way harder to land a tech job as a fresher? According to data from DD, the biggest tech companies, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Nvidia, and Palanteer have had zero net growth in hiring over the last 3 years. That's right, zero growth. The total headcount today is basically the same as it was 3 years ago. So, what exactly is happening during the pandemic? These companies went on a massive hiring spree. Just look at this graph. That huge spike in 2022, that's when they collectively added over 120,000 employees in a single year. But then in 2023, we actually saw negative growth with companies cutting jobs. But the big question is, how are these tech giants growing their businesses without growing their teams? It boils down to these four fundamental changes. First, they overhired during the zero interest rate pandemic years between 2020 and 2022, assuming the demand boom would continue long-term. It did not. Second, with higher interest rates now, CFOs are under intense pressure to improve operating margins, and keeping headcount flat is the most direct way to boost those numbers. Third, these companies are investing billions in generative AI infrastructure. The cost of capital for these chips and systems is enormous, leaving less budget for new hires. Fourth, there's emerging evidence that AI productivity tools might already be enabling these companies to accomplish more with their existing workforce. This last point is actually huge because it's changing a fundamental relationship in business. The data historically showed that if a company's revenue grew by 10%, its headcount would also grow by about 10%. But these AI productivity gains are breaking that pattern. Now these tech leaders are testing whether they can grow revenue without growing headcount at all. This represents the potential end of the hyperrowth hiring era that defined tech from 2010 to 2021.",Have you noticed it's gotten way harder to land a tech job as a fresher According to data from DD the biggest tech companies Google Microsoft Apple Tesla Meta Nvidia and Palanteer have had zero net growth in hiring over the last 3 years That's right zero growth The total headcount today is basically the same as it was 3 years ago So what exactly is happening during the pandemic These companies went on a massive hiring spree Just look at this graph That huge spike in 2022 that's when they collectively added over 120000 employees in a single year But then in 2023 we actually saw negative growth with companies cutting jobs But the big question is how are these tech giants growing their businesses without growing their teams It boils down to these four fundamental changes First they overhired during the zero interest rate pandemic years between 2020 and 2022 assuming the demand boom would continue long-term It did not Second with higher interest rates now CFOs are under intense pressure to improve operating margins and keeping headcount flat is the most direct way to boost those numbers Third these companies are investing billions in generative AI infrastructure The cost of capital for these chips and systems is enormous leaving less budget for new hires Fourth there's emerging evidence that AI productivity tools might already be enabling these companies to accomplish more with their existing workforce This last point is actually huge because it's changing a fundamental relationship in business The data historically showed that if a company's revenue grew by 10% its headcount would also grow by about 10% But these AI productivity gains are breaking that pattern Now these tech leaders are testing whether they can grow revenue without growing headcount at all This represents the potential end of the hyperrowth hiring era that defined tech from 2010 to 2021,

Now, I want tentacles all over my face. Now, we're going to have somebody from the comment section punch me. Now I'm going to disintegrate. All of these effects were created with AI using a tool called Higs Field. Here's how it works. Now, all you have to do is upload a first frame from your video and go to the effects panel. That's it. Choose your desired effect, such as Venom taking over your body, getting punched, or turning into metal. The software uses AI to analyze your image and apply realistic transformations that follow your movements throughout the clip. What's mind-blowing is that until recently, these effects would have taken professional VFX artists hours or even days to create. They'd have to manually track every movement and adjust the effect frame by frame. But now, this tech does it automatically in minutes. The coolest part is that this tech is accessible to everyone.

6LxjHqQnjkw,Fortnite&#39;s darth vader just got jailbroken and it&#39;s hilarious!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LxjHqQnjkw,"Fortnite's Darth Vader just got jailbroken and people are making it say anything they want. I find your enthusiasm unsettling Peter Griffin and gooning gang. Explain this adolescent term. Now, we can't tell you what it means for obvious reasons, but it shows Peter Griffin holding a lightsaber and facing off with Darth Vader. But instead of Vader saying something serious like he usually does, he says something totally unexpected. So, how did this happen? Well, it's because Epic Games added characters like Darth Vader using AI so players could interact with them. According to Fortnite's website, when players talk to Darth Vader, their voice gets converted into text and fed into Google's Gemini, which writes a reply matching Darth Vader's personality. Then 11 Labs, a texttovoice model, takes that reply and speaks it out loud in Vader's voice. Now, that's what should have happened ideally, but players quickly realized that by asking Vader to repeat after me or using clever replies, they could bypass Fortnite's filters and trick Gemini into saying almost anything they want. In other words, they weren't exactly hacking the system, but manipulating Gemini by finding loopholes in how LLM understand language. While this might be funny to some, remember that Fortnite is played by millions of kids as well, and pre-exposing them to such stuff probably isn't good for them. Epic Games says they've now fixed the issue with a hot fix and added more safety checks. Like, if a player is under 13, they cannot talk to these AI characters without parental consent. But it'll be interesting to see what happens",Fortnite's Darth Vader just got jailbroken and people are making it say anything they want I find your enthusiasm unsettling Peter Griffin and gooning gang Explain this adolescent term Now we can't tell you what it means for obvious reasons but it shows Peter Griffin holding a lightsaber and facing off with Darth Vader But instead of Vader saying something serious like he usually does he says something totally unexpected So how did this happen Well it's because Epic Games added characters like Darth Vader using AI so players could interact with them According to Fortnite's website when players talk to Darth Vader their voice gets converted into text and fed into Google's Gemini which writes a reply matching Darth Vader's personality Then 11 Labs a texttovoice model takes that reply and speaks it out loud in Vader's voice Now that's what should have happened ideally but players quickly realized that by asking Vader to repeat after me or using clever replies they could bypass Fortnite's filters and trick Gemini into saying almost anything they want In other words they weren't exactly hacking the system but manipulating Gemini by finding loopholes in how LLM understand language While this might be funny to some remember that Fortnite is played by millions of kids as well and pre-exposing them to such stuff probably isn't good for them Epic Games says they've now fixed the issue with a hot fix and added more safety checks Like if a player is under 13 they cannot talk to these AI characters without parental consent But it'll be interesting to see what happens,
sNwjou1CUI0,Chinese Version Of Tesla Cybertruck!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNwjou1CUI0,"This Chinese version of Tesla's Cybert truck might actually be better than the original. It's called the Gak Pickup 01. And while it definitely borrows that stainless steel angular look, it packs some features Tesla doesn't have. Let me show you why this truck is so cool. First up, there's the smart suspension system. This truck has sensors that scan the road a thousand times every second. When it detects bumps or dips, it automatically adjusts each wheel independently to keep the body perfectly level. Then there is design, which is clearly inspired by Tesla with that distinctive stainless steel body that won't rust and doesn't need paint. Of course, Gak added its own style with sleek LED light strips across the front and back and chunky off-road tires that look ready for any adventure. Now, inside the car, it gets really interesting. The steering wheel can actually slide from the left side to the right side of the dashboard. This means they can sell the exact same truck in America, Australia, Japan, anywhere without making different versions for different markets. That's some clever engineering. However, Gak outshines Tesla in its adaptability. While Tesla locked their Cybert truck into one fixed layout, Gak completely rethought what a truck cabin could be. They created a modular system where you can slide different setups in and out depending on what you need that day. When it comes to raw power, GAK claims 12,000 new m of torque at the wheels. That's the force that gets you moving and pulling heavy loads. Tesla's Cybert truck edges ahead with 14,000 new m. But both trucks have more than enough power for most people's needs. Of course, there's a catch. While people are already driving Cybert trucks on American roads, the Gak Pickup01 is still just a concept that won't hit production until around 2027. Pricing hasn't been announced yet, but if Gak can land anywhere near the rumored sub $40,000 mark, it could make this thing a serious competitor to Tesla.",This Chinese version of Tesla's Cybert truck might actually be better than the original It's called the Gak Pickup 01 And while it definitely borrows that stainless steel angular look it packs some features Tesla doesn't have Let me show you why this truck is so cool First up there's the smart suspension system This truck has sensors that scan the road a thousand times every second When it detects bumps or dips it automatically adjusts each wheel independently to keep the body perfectly level Then there is design which is clearly inspired by Tesla with that distinctive stainless steel body that won't rust and doesn't need paint Of course Gak added its own style with sleek LED light strips across the front and back and chunky off-road tires that look ready for any adventure Now inside the car it gets really interesting The steering wheel can actually slide from the left side to the right side of the dashboard This means they can sell the exact same truck in America Australia Japan anywhere without making different versions for different markets That's some clever engineering However Gak outshines Tesla in its adaptability While Tesla locked their Cybert truck into one fixed layout Gak completely rethought what a truck cabin could be They created a modular system where you can slide different setups in and out depending on what you need that day When it comes to raw power GAK claims 12000 new m of torque at the wheels That's the force that gets you moving and pulling heavy loads Tesla's Cybert truck edges ahead with 14000 new m But both trucks have more than enough power for most people's needs Of course there's a catch While people are already driving Cybert trucks on American roads the Gak Pickup01 is still just a concept that won't hit production until around 2027 Pricing hasn't been announced yet but if Gak can land anywhere near the rumored sub $40000 mark it could make this thing a serious competitor to Tesla,
749idCMlNfo,OpenAI Just Made the Biggest AI Acquisition Ever,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=749idCMlNfo,"Reports say OpenAI is likely to acquire Windsurf for $3 billion. This might be one of the biggest AI acquisitions ever. So, what exactly is Windsurf? Back in December 2022, it was called Kodium, a free AI coding assistant. The CEO posted it on Hacker News saying they wanted to open up access of generative AI to all developers for free. But check out what one user commented. What's the difference with Copilot? In my exact 3minut test, it did worse, even if only slightly. Right now, it is free, but that won't last, right? Do I have to expect any shady data collection practices? More interestingly, how is this trained? Have you guys done your own fine-tuning of GPT3 or is it something completely different? Fast forward to today and that same tool someone brushed off is now potentially worth $3 billion. This completely challenges the common advice that you shouldn't just build rappers around AI APIs. And companies like Windsurf prove there's massive value in making AI more accessible to developers. Now, you know, the AI world moves at lightning speed. A product casually dismissed after a three-minute test is now just 3 years later at the center of what could be one of the biggest AI acquisitions ever.

IFAdoXja4o0,The WORLD&#39;S FIRST Video Edited by BRAIN WAVES!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFAdoXja4o0,"You're looking at the first ever video edited using only thoughts. This is the first video edited with the Neuralink. This is my old voice narrating this video cloned by AI from recordings before I lost my voice. This is Brad, an ALS patient who can't move or speak, but can somehow control his MacBook using just his thoughts thanks to Neuralink. It all starts with a tiny coinsized chip placed inside Brad's motor cortex, the part of the brain responsible for movement. Now, from this chip, about 1,024 ultra thin electrodes are inserted directly into the soft jelly-like brain matter, carefully listening to individual neurons. Now, every time Brad thinks about something, like moving his tongue or clenching his jaw, specific neurons activate. The electrodes then pick up this neural activity and send it to the chip where an AI decodes these signals and turns Brad's thoughts into precise cursor movements and clicks. What's mind-blowing is how this entire process happens every 15 milliseconds, which is as real time as it gets. But Brad didn't use it to just click around. He edited an entire video, dragging files, navigating menus, trimming clips, picking transitions, and even fine-tuning the timeline using nothing but his thoughts and an AI clone of his voice. What's even more impressive is that unlike eyetracking systems that don't work in bright light, Neuralink works anywhere. It doesn't care if you're indoors, outdoors, sitting, lying down. It just listens to your brain. That's it. And this is just the beginning. Imagine a future where two people could talk without even saying a word. where you could just think about something and the decoded signals could be sent directly to another person's implant and stimulate the right neurons, transmitting ideas directly with near zero information loss.

Now, researchers at the University of Zurich secretly slipped AI bots into social media conversations, and no one even realized they weren't talking to real people. Here's how it went down. The researchers set up 13 AI powered accounts on Reddit's Change My View subreddit, a community specifically designed for people to share their opinions and invite others to challenge or change their perspective. But here's the shocking part, how these bots actually worked. They analyzed the person's entire Reddit posting history to figure out their age, gender, location, political beliefs, and even their likes and dislikes based on their profile. Sometimes the AI even crafted elaborate fake personas. One AI accused members of a religious group of causing the deaths of hundreds of innocent traders, farmers, and villagers. Another posed as a trauma counselor specializing in abuse. One AI even claimed to be a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter. The Reddit moderators discovered this experiment after the fact and were furious. They filed an ethics complaint with the university, arguing that people come to their forum to engage with other humans, not to be unwitting subjects in an AI experiment. This connects to what some refer to as the dead internet theory. The notion that increasingly our online interactions may be with AI bots rather than real humans. As these bots become more sophisticated and widespread, how will we know who or what we're really talking to? I find this both fascinating and deeply unsettling. Technology is amazing, but we need transparency about who's behind the screen.

5H8m7MFWcPA,Slate: The World&#39;s Most Customisable EV Ever!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H8m7MFWcPA,"This is Slate, the world's most customizable EV ever. And you can change nearly everything. Its color, lights, interior, bumpers, screens, and even converted into an SUV. What's even more impressive is that it's cheaper than a Tesla at just $20,000. And that's no coincidence. If you look closely at the name, you'll notice that the name Slate is actually an anagram of Tesla, meaning it has the exact same letters, just rearranged. And that's exactly what Slate is doing. It's taking what Tesla built, futuristic, cool, and expensive cars, and rearranging it into something more minimal, simpler, and affordable. Now, a lot of people on X have even been suggesting that it might actually be a subbrand of Tesla to attract a more affordable customer base. But in reality, it's backed by Jeff Bezos, one of Elon's biggest rivals in the space race already. And that alone makes Slate even more intriguing. Is Slate trying to beat Tesla just like Blue Origin is trying to beat SpaceX? Maybe, maybe not. But what's clear is while the world is going crazy over futuristic looking EVs, Slate is taking a minimalistic approach by doing the opposite. Keeping things simple, affordable, and letting you decide what's really important.",This is Slate the world's most customizable EV ever And you can change nearly everything Its color lights interior bumpers screens and even converted into an SUV What's even more impressive is that it's cheaper than a Tesla at just $20000 And that's no coincidence If you look closely at the name you'll notice that the name Slate is actually an anagram of Tesla meaning it has the exact same letters just rearranged And that's exactly what Slate is doing It's taking what Tesla built futuristic cool and expensive cars and rearranging it into something more minimal simpler and affordable Now a lot of people on X have even been suggesting that it might actually be a subbrand of Tesla to attract a more affordable customer base But in reality it's backed by Jeff Bezos one of Elon's biggest rivals in the space race already And that alone makes Slate even more intriguing Is Slate trying to beat Tesla just like Blue Origin is trying to beat SpaceX Maybe maybe not But what's clear is while the world is going crazy over futuristic looking EVs Slate is taking a minimalistic approach by doing the opposite Keeping things simple affordable and letting you decide what's really important,
Gw20CwE5x-w,This AI changes your accent in REAL-TIME!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw20CwE5x-w,"If you've ever been a call center agent with an Indian English accent, this new AI tool called crisp accent conversion lets you transform your speech into standard American English in real time while you're talking. My name is Manoj and I'm a call center agent from India. Clear communication is vital for my customers and me, but accent barriers can sometimes make it challenging. Let me show you the voice preservation mode in action. This mode keeps my original voice intact while softening challenging parts of my accent. It helps customers understand me better, improving satisfaction on both sides of the call. This mood allows me to stay authentic, making every interaction more personal and effective. Now, the AI operates through a virtual audio driver with just 200 milliseconds of latency. That's faster than the human perception of conversation. Plus, Crisp trained their AI on thousands of paired recordings of Indian English and American English speech patterns to make this possible. However, it preserves your unique voice characteristics while modifying the pronunciation and intonation patterns. It's essentially changing how you sound without altering your voice. Now, this tech is just weird, isn't it? It's like we're creating digital masks for our voices. Think about it. Your accent is part of your identity, your story, your culture, and now an AI can just strip that away in milliseconds. But what do you think about this? Is there something strange about an AI that can erase part of who you are from your voice? Or is it just a practical tool for better communication?

9Csd_qZyt3c,Revealing New Realistic Game From India?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Csd_qZyt3c,"Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Applause] It's been a while. This entire thing that we're about to do right now, it's going to be short in one take. There's no script. Uh we're doing it a day in advance because it's just easier. It avoids all the tragedies that can occur with power outages. But ladies and gentlemen, in the last two years, AOS has really grown. We're close to about 300 employees at this point. And it's just been a phenomenal ride. We have set a benchmark when it comes to video, not just across India, but globally. And a lot of people in India now recognize that. A lot of people globally recognize our standard, the standards we've set in video. But I wasn't satisfied. As we grew, I said, ""There's something I've been wanting to do since I was a kid, and it's very expensive to do. It is technically very difficult to pull off. It requires too many things to come together."" And I said, ""If I don't, who will? Someone's got to try."" So, I've hyped this project enough. Let's get straight into it. Ladies and gentlemen, today I want to introduce you to something that's taken 8 months, 40 people, really skilled people, and we've done it in utmost secrecy, and I hope you really like it. Ready? Here goes. I bet there are a lot of people leaving from the live stream right now. It's a watch. It tells the time. It's not smart. There's no AI. I mean, what more do you expect from creators or influencers or whatever? Right. This is the best that uh us as a class can do. Right. Right. I think we can do a lot better. In fact, this entire box here, it's misdirection. We don't actually need it. I practiced that for a bit. So ladies and gentlemen, without much further ado, I hope you're watching this in 4K because let the footage roll. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm so sorry. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Hey. [Music] Wow. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hey, What you saw was really special because it's just a small fraction of what's already built. And there's something very special that happened. A very specific technological shift that just it's not even a shift. It's just something that got really good. And no, it has nothing to do with AI. There was negligible AI in what you saw right now. And I don't expect text to 3D to be really good this year. I don't even expect it to be good next year. So this was done in an old school way but in a very different manner with a very different pipeline. And I want to shed some light on it because it was so much monumental effort and like I told you what you saw was just a fraction of what we have already built. You see we set a benchmark in video content. Globally we're known for that. So we now want to set a benchmark in this new industry. And we are going to do it by setting our standards for quality so high that when you see it, you can't tell where it came from except for the where the story has come from and what the assets kind of look like, where the origin of the assets is. But I had somebody recently go out and put another very high-quality AAA game that just came out, some screenshots of it, compared to screenshots of some of our levels and some of the assets that we had generated and created without any of the set dressing because sometimes that can mislead people and without any of the extra environmental work and ask people to rate it. Most people rated us either on par or above the other competitor, which is crazy considering that this is of Indian origin and this hasn't been done so far. But I need to tell you the secret because it is a big one. 100% of the following screenshots that you're going to see on your screen right now were captured in engine. Take a look. So, what changed and why is this special? It's special because we now have one of the largest scan libraries for a game in the world. We have over a thousand assets. That's right. Over a thousand assets that's been scanned specifically for this game with the highest of quality cameras with technique that only a video company would really understand well. And it's very easy for us to adopt a photogometry technique, at least the way we're supposed to do it. At least the way we're supposed to do it to get super high quality assets. We've adopted it. And the way we did it was crazy. We blocked out an entire town. That's right. We went out and blocked an entire town, the town of Chanderei. And we had our team scan it. a very expensive affair. I wouldn't recommend to anybody watching. But not only did we send up video teams there, we not only scanned the buildings, we also used drones to scan, you know, floor 2, floor 3, uh, 15th century architecture. It really was the most grueling process for the team. And that was followed up that was followed up by the most monumental 3D cleanup effort that I think any team here has undertaken because just scanned assets are not good enough. You also need to be able to clean them. You also need to have an actual artist with 3D modeling, not just 3D modeling skill, but artistic sense to go in and say, ""Well, the window sill is not perfect. I need to fix that."" Well, the handle of the auto is not perfect. I need to fix that. Well, the front of the um, you know, uh, scooter is not perfect. I need to replace that, you know, area. Somebody with that skill and we had to have a huge team of them actually sitting together cleaning up all of this. Really, if I knew everything I knew both about the expense and the amount of coordination this takes, I probably wouldn't have done this. But thankfully, we're done now. And we have the largest scan library, one of the largest scan libraries for a game ever. I want to show you some of the scans. This is something that will hopefully interest you. As you can see, this is not a photo. It's not a picture. This is actually a 3D asset. And as you can see, even with things like the fruits, we had to actually go scan them. We have to make sure things that can't easily be scanned like tires and spokes. We had to remodel. So it's not this magical technique where you press a button everything gets done. But there's just lot of human effort that went into this. And we didn't stop just at environmental assets. We went and also got the most authentic clothing from India and worked really hard on scanning them and getting them into engine which means we needed to build our own rig. And this is where a lot of people have this very myopic view of engineering, right? Either you're an engineer that just writes front end code or whatever. Like we think that's so myopic and I've said this for so many years because what we did was we sliced an office chair in half. We turned it around. We motorized it so it can turn. Then we put a wood plate on top of it. Then we put markers so that the scanning software can understand the scene better. Then we put a mannequin on top. Then we set up a perfect light box that only us as a video company. I mean other people could possibly do it but it is it's hard to get that perfect photogometry lighting. You need perfectly even lighting uh so that there's no baked shadows that you can kind of see in the scene or bake lights that you can see in the scene. We had to set up you know an arm. We had to put the camera with uh you know flash and then a polariz on top of it so that it's not able to you know pick up too much of the reflective surfaces. We had to put all this together and automate the entire process as we moved the arm and automatically hit the flash as the cam as the um wheel kept turning. It was I mean I don't even know how to describe it. It's just it's such a it's such a good example of Indian jugad. The ability to do things even when we might not have the means or the resources. Very hard to get a rig in India. And honestly, it's not that we couldn't afford the rig. is that it's just impossible to get it down in India and we'd have, you know, hell to face with customs. So, we just decided, let's just make it ourselves. Now, the scans alone aren't enough. You actually have to create the other maps for this object. So, you need to now create the roughness map. You need to make sure you figure out how shiny it is. You need to create the metallic map. Uh, if it's got metal parts, you wanted to actually make it seem like it's there in the real scene in game. Uh, so it's a lot of work, post-process work, even after you got the scans done. And for a lot of the smaller scans simply because we're scanning a huge volume of clothes, we just went with phones. As long as the lighting setup is good enough, it's not that the actual equipment is the blocker. It is the fact that you need to get the setup well and make the entire process happen. Then the entire process of rettopology, which means we need to create these scans and we need to make sure the mesh structure, which is absolute garbage that comes out from scans, works in a game. Which means when you're actually simulating these objects in game, you're simulating a doti in game, they actually feel and look real. And sometimes you have to bake them down into simpler structures, right? So a lot of work that went in making sure these are game ready and then composited on top. And then we also scanned human faces that actually exist in India, people who actually exist in India and added our own flare on top of them. We will recreate the entire city of Chanderi in the game. We're not going to call it Chanderi just because we want we have a story in mind and we're going to retell the entire story of the Ramayan and we didn't want to retell the entire story of the Ramayan back in the day because somebody or the or the other will misinterpret it and we just wanted to have the freedom to tell our own story with while being super respectful of the original source material. So we sort of did a loose retelling of the story in modern India and you know there's parts that are there in modern cities and I know there are lots of people that have been talking about you know showing an Indian city in a game for a very long time a high quality city the best method was just to scan it and put it in because scanning got really good in the last few months it's just a herculan effort to pull it off and requires a lot less of sitting on the computer and a lot more of going out and blocking the entire town. We literally had to block the entire town and get permissions. It was I don't recommend it anybody to do it again. But a game is not just assets. If you just stop at assets, cool. You're an asset library company. But a game is more than that. When I grew up playing games, there were specific instances, specific bosses that I remember fighting against that I still remember to today. I carry those memories with me. And I feel we have this responsibility, right, if we are making games to make characters and personalities that people carry for the rest of their lives as a memory. So we wanted to come up with the best story, the best game design. And while I can't spoil too much of the story, we actually put a lot of effort in coming up with a story that everybody will resonate with. A story that where you start with, you know, where most of us are in life and then go through the quest not for strength directly but for wisdom first and then for strength. Kind of like my life. I had to take a pit stop at the wisdom, you know, restaurant to then be able to carry on with my life and gain strength and power, right? I think that should be true for everybody. And the game not only is an excellent combat experience based on Sakiro the combat systems, we've also built a lot of things from scratch that make it uniquely Indian and uniquely something that doesn't exist on the game stores today in any game store because it's just the way we thought about this. The approach that we have is a complete outsider approach. So it feels and looks different. It will feel a lot different from everything else that hopefully has come in the past. And it's not, it just doesn't even end there. It's almost like a never- ending project, right? We had to put in so much time and effort actually doing animations. So, you can take a look at some of the mocap BTS that we have here. Uh, it's a lot of sitting in suits. The animations from the suits aren't perfect. So, you need human animators. You need real people who are going in there and exaggerating the effects a little bit, making sure it looks real. It's a lot of effort. And I know I've said that a million times, but if you knew how much effort this was going in and how much money it would cost, we probably wouldn't do it, right? But it is what it is. Foolishness is important for you to get in. But once you get in, I feel like now we've just made so much more progress than than everything that exists. So there's a lot of manual effort that's gone into this. But lastly, in order to make those combat systems I spoke about, in order to make the gameplay feel very responsive, in order to create our own behavior trees uh and not have to rely just on the Unreal Engine ones to make ours goal directed, we had to write an obscene amount of C++. You know, there's this thing that game developers say uh when front-end engineers talk about performance issues, we call them jokes. All of us call them jokes because we just feel like the amount of effort, every strand of hair we need to worry about, right? Every every single vertex we need to be like that's too much. We got to worry about it. Number of characters in a scene we got to worry about it. So I really feel like there's a lot of optimization work that we had to do. And I need to come back to the idea that even after you do all of this, even after you figure out all the programmatic parts, there's still so much manual effort. Like I want to show you a picture of an auto straight from a scan that we had to fix or clean up. It's just so much hellish work. You can look at these fruits that we had to sit and manually clean up. It's just a lot of work, right? And parts of the scans are missing. Like this just I mentioned this like 50 times, but it was a lot of work. And I'm glad that we reached this end of the tunnel where the game is actually 60 70% done. And now from here to where it goes, I think it's a lot easier because we've already processed so many assets. We've already fixed so many assets. Uh there's a huge number of modelers on this. Like I mentioned, there's 40 people on the team. So before I move any further, I want to quickly talk about the team because this is not a indie shop where it's just one or two people doing it. It's a large team working on it. Maybe not the size of most AAA companies, but we do feel that most of those AAA companies are still, you know, using old flows, right? They're not they've not moved to photoggramometry as yet because they haven't figured out it's gotten good in the last 6 8 months. They haven't kept track of this space and they're mid project. So it's hard for them to switch out. So they will become smaller over time too. And I feel like size when you're that big, when you're 100 people, it's a little bit hard. At 40 people, I think we have just the right size. We're still hiring another 20, 25 people. There's still a lot more work left to do. But I quickly want to introduce you to the team. So on the programming side, the person leading it is Rishi. Rishi has extensive experience building a lot of games by himself. He's actually very young, but he's built a lot of games by himself. And he's also built a game engine even before he walked into these halls. And now he's written hundreds of thousands of lines of C++ and it's just been it's just been a treat to watch. He's built a lot of systems from scratch and you guys will enjoy playing the game. I hope you guys enjoy playing the game as much as he enjoyed building it. Next we have Davi who is actually from Think Tank which is one of the number one schools for game development and VFX across the world. Uh if you go to Think Tank's website, you can see some of the work she's made and she's a great 3D artist who likes working with her hands, who likes building things from scratch, and you'll see a lot of her assets in the game. Then we have Suge who's who goes by Hansy Sujay and Su has worked on an extensive range of titles from Hogwarts Legacy to Horizon Forbidden West to even go to Sushima. So SU has got seven years of experience doing character modeling. We needed someone senior there, someone who's an artist who has an eye for all of these things and so has just done a fantastic job. Right? The entire pipeline, both the photoggramometry as well as the handmade pipeline is both run by him. Uh then we have Krishna who is the animator from Ant-Man quantum. Krishna has actually worked on Ant-Man quantum mania. So you've seen Ant-Man quantum mania, you've probably seen his work. So we have him actually going in fixing the animations, thinking about how the cinematic should be structured. So it is a pretty good team. Then we have Din whose you know experience and credits who used to work at Dag but his experience and credits include films like Mickey 17 and Aquaman. I think that every India already had the latent demand or the latent need desire to actually go out and make a game. It's not we didn't have a skill issue ever right. I thought I think it's mostly the fact that we just didn't have either the courage or the ability to put things together or the ability to see the grand vision, the ability to spend so much. Um, and of course without photogometry, this will have to be a much larger team. So a much bigger undertaking. So I just feel that uh I'm so glad these guys decided to come do this with us. We spoke to so many 3D modelers who said, ""Oh, no, but this is good, but I still,"" even though we were paying, we were offering more, they were like, ""Oh, but I I want to go work at this bigname 3D, you know, I want to go work at a big name outsourcing shop in India, right?"" So, it's very hard to get people to take a risk and I understand why, but uh I'm so glad these people took a risk. Then we have Pari who even though Pari doesn't have big titles to his name, you can see some of his work online and he's done an extensive amount of work and Par was the hardest worker because he had to catch up to the rest of the team. So, he's done an excellent job at cleaning up the photoggramometry scans and leading that team and making sure that, you know, the assets that come out in the levels and the set dressing that come out in some of the levels that you saw in the trailer and some of what you'll see on the website, he's put in a lot of effort there. And it's almost like when you're playing catchup, you're like, I want to be as good as the best and he always had the potential. He's always worked by himself for years and now finally he get the opportunity to to take it to the world. And then of course the person running AOS games because I do AOS and my job is to keep looking for the next interesting thing that we can potentially be the best at spend 6 8 10 months in this case probably 2 years spearheading the first good product back then it was the first few good videos set the process but the CEO of this company is Rohan who's my brother who is XY combinator and we made games before we've always spoken about making games we made overpowered card game last year uh which is probably defunct now but before that we've made you know small games that we used to constantly have fun doing we built something called Mumbai make harda many years ago you can find it on it.io IO uh we always wanted to make a game. We knew it was very expensive. We knew that the potential ROI of this is zero. Uh but someone's got to try and so glad he's leading this because I can really count on him. So there are a few more people I want to talk about. One of them is Vishal who used to run this VFX cinematics firm called 20s. He's done a fantastic job of uh sort of making cinematics for clients with VFX. And when we gave him the shot at making cinematics for the game in engine, he said, ""This is going to this is a dream and I would love to do this."" So, he's done a fantastic job. So, you've seen some of his work in the trailer. You'll probably, you know, you you'll see some of his work online. And as time goes by, as we leak more things, you'll probably see some more of it. And then finally, we have who's helped us with a lot of the coordination. And then apart from this core team, we have a huge team actually sitting down doing cleanup, doing art, doing modeling who all sit between below the people that I've spoke about so far. And of course there are people who are not directly involved but sort of involved which is we have so many people here at AOS who are actually helping us with things like audio like we find the right person because we've got video and content people here. So audio, audio mixing, video. We have so many people here that are helpful. And uh yeah, I just want to say that at this point we know 100% of how to make a super high quality game. Like we think we can hit the global benchmark and this is iteratively going to keep getting better because 3 months ago if you saw where it was some of the people that saw the demos they thought it was good but now it's even better and it's going to keep getting better as we infuse more of India as we make it more Bollywood style. It'll be very unique. Nobody would seen a game like this. And yes, we're going to try to get it on PC and consoles. We'll figure out in what order and you know, we'll figure out all those things later. Um, but we are also humble enough to know that nobody can predict success. We can try, we can give it our best shot, but nobody can predict success, uh, financial success, but we think we know how to make it. We think we know the entire sequence of things. We know how much effort it takes. We know exactly how much it costs at this point. We won't breathe easy till it's done. So ladies and gentlemen, that was Lean. It's called Unleash the Avatar. It'll come fall of next year, 2026. And I'm so honored that we were able to do it. I can't leak too much about the story, but uh but you'll find out details soon enough. The best thing you can do is really share this. I know that making a game is too expensive for most people or it's too hard to put all these things together or you know skills might be a challenge and we're always hiring if if you are skilled and you want a shot at this but we do think the ways to supporters are really sharing it far and wide. The hard part is not building things anymore even with a game. Sure it's very very difficult and we've we've moved a lot of things to make it happen but it's also about getting enough of the reach. That's why I had to spend so much time hyping this because the project's risk is so high that if we don't get enough exposure then and this doesn't go to the markets where it matters like the US and Canada and places like that then we probably don't have enough of a shot of being a financial success which is which means I lose all my money. I'm a bootstrap company so it is financially stressful but u I'm hoping you help us with that. Anyway, thanks for tuning in. Bye.","Heat Music Music Heat Heat Heat Heat Music Music Applause Heat Music Heat Music Heat Heat Heat Music Music Music Heat Music Heat Music Heat Heat Music Music Applause It's been a while This entire thing that we're about to do right now it's going to be short in one take There's no script Uh we're doing it a day in advance because it's just easier It avoids all the tragedies that can occur with power outages But ladies and gentlemen in the last two years AOS has really grown We're close to about 300 employees at this point And it's just been a phenomenal ride We have set a benchmark when it comes to video not just across India but globally And a lot of people in India now recognize that A lot of people globally recognize our standard the standards we've set in video But I wasn't satisfied As we grew I said ""There's something I've been wanting to do since I was a kid and it's very expensive to do It is technically very difficult to pull off It requires too many things to come together"" And I said ""If I don't who will Someone's got to try"" So I've hyped this project enough Let's get straight into it Ladies and gentlemen today I want to introduce you to something that's taken 8 months 40 people really skilled people and we've done it in utmost secrecy and I hope you really like it Ready Here goes I bet there are a lot of people leaving from the live stream right now It's a watch It tells the time It's not smart There's no AI I mean what more do you expect from creators or influencers or whatever Right This is the best that uh us as a class can do Right Right I think we can do a lot better In fact this entire box here it's misdirection We don't actually need it I practiced that for a bit So ladies and gentlemen without much further ado I hope you're watching this in 4K because let the footage roll Music Music Music Music Music Music I'm so sorry Music Music Heat Heat Heat Heat Music Music Hey Music Wow Heat Music Heat Heat Music Hey What you saw was really special because it's just a small fraction of what's already built And there's something very special that happened A very specific technological shift that just it's not even a shift It's just something that got really good And no it has nothing to do with AI There was negligible AI in what you saw right now And I don't expect text to 3D to be really good this year I don't even expect it to be good next year So this was done in an old school way but in a very different manner with a very different pipeline And I want to shed some light on it because it was so much monumental effort and like I told you what you saw was just a fraction of what we have already built You see we set a benchmark in video content Globally we're known for that So we now want to set a benchmark in this new industry And we are going to do it by setting our standards for quality so high that when you see it you can't tell where it came from except for the where the story has come from and what the assets kind of look like where the origin of the assets is But I had somebody recently go out and put another very high-quality AAA game that just came out some screenshots of it compared to screenshots of some of our levels and some of the assets that we had generated and created without any of the set dressing because sometimes that can mislead people and without any of the extra environmental work and ask people to rate it Most people rated us either on par or above the other competitor which is crazy considering that this is of Indian origin and this hasn't been done so far But I need to tell you the secret because it is a big one 100% of the following screenshots that you're going to see on your screen right now were captured in engine Take a look So what changed and why is this special It's special because we now have one of the largest scan libraries for a game in the world We have over a thousand assets That's right Over a thousand assets that's been scanned specifically for this game with the highest of quality cameras with technique that only a video company would really understand well And it's very easy for us to adopt a photogometry technique at least the way we're supposed to do it At least the way we're supposed to do it to get super high quality assets We've adopted it And the way we did it was crazy We blocked out an entire town That's right We went out and blocked an entire town the town of Chanderei And we had our team scan it a very expensive affair I wouldn't recommend to anybody watching But not only did we send up video teams there we not only scanned the buildings we also used drones to scan you know floor 2 floor 3 uh 15th century architecture It really was the most grueling process for the team And that was followed up that was followed up by the most monumental 3D cleanup effort that I think any team here has undertaken because just scanned assets are not good enough You also need to be able to clean them You also need to have an actual artist with 3D modeling not just 3D modeling skill but artistic sense to go in and say ""Well the window sill is not perfect I need to fix that"" Well the handle of the auto is not perfect I need to fix that Well the front of the um you know uh scooter is not perfect I need to replace that you know area Somebody with that skill and we had to have a huge team of them actually sitting together cleaning up all of this Really if I knew everything I knew both about the expense and the amount of coordination this takes I probably wouldn't have done this But thankfully we're done now And we have the largest scan library one of the largest scan libraries for a game ever I want to show you some of the scans This is something that will hopefully interest you As you can see this is not a photo It's not a picture This is actually a 3D asset And as you can see even with things like the fruits we had to actually go scan them We have to make sure things that can't easily be scanned like tires and spokes We had to remodel So it's not this magical technique where you press a button everything gets done But there's just lot of human effort that went into this And we didn't stop just at environmental assets We went and also got the most authentic clothing from India and worked really hard on scanning them and getting them into engine which means we needed to build our own rig And this is where a lot of people have this very myopic view of engineering right Either you're an engineer that just writes front end code or whatever Like we think that's so myopic and I've said this for so many years because what we did was we sliced an office chair in half We turned it around We motorized it so it can turn Then we put a wood plate on top of it Then we put markers so that the scanning software can understand the scene better Then we put a mannequin on top Then we set up a perfect light box that only us as a video company I mean other people could possibly do it but it is it's hard to get that perfect photogometry lighting You need perfectly even lighting uh so that there's no baked shadows that you can kind of see in the scene or bake lights that you can see in the scene We had to set up you know an arm We had to put the camera with uh you know flash and then a polariz on top of it so that it's not able to you know pick up too much of the reflective surfaces We had to put all this together and automate the entire process as we moved the arm and automatically hit the flash as the cam as the um wheel kept turning It was I mean I don't even know how to describe it It's just it's such a it's such a good example of Indian jugad The ability to do things even when we might not have the means or the resources Very hard to get a rig in India And honestly it's not that we couldn't afford the rig is that it's just impossible to get it down in India and we'd have you know hell to face with customs So we just decided let's just make it ourselves Now the scans alone aren't enough You actually have to create the other maps for this object So you need to now create the roughness map You need to make sure you figure out how shiny it is You need to create the metallic map Uh if it's got metal parts you wanted to actually make it seem like it's there in the real scene in game Uh so it's a lot of work post-process work even after you got the scans done And for a lot of the smaller scans simply because we're scanning a huge volume of clothes we just went with phones As long as the lighting setup is good enough it's not that the actual equipment is the blocker It is the fact that you need to get the setup well and make the entire process happen Then the entire process of rettopology which means we need to create these scans and we need to make sure the mesh structure which is absolute garbage that comes out from scans works in a game Which means when you're actually simulating these objects in game you're simulating a doti in game they actually feel and look real And sometimes you have to bake them down into simpler structures right So a lot of work that went in making sure these are game ready and then composited on top And then we also scanned human faces that actually exist in India people who actually exist in India and added our own flare on top of them We will recreate the entire city of Chanderi in the game We're not going to call it Chanderi just because we want we have a story in mind and we're going to retell the entire story of the Ramayan and we didn't want to retell the entire story of the Ramayan back in the day because somebody or the or the other will misinterpret it and we just wanted to have the freedom to tell our own story with while being super respectful of the original source material So we sort of did a loose retelling of the story in modern India and you know there's parts that are there in modern cities and I know there are lots of people that have been talking about you know showing an Indian city in a game for a very long time a high quality city the best method was just to scan it and put it in because scanning got really good in the last few months it's just a herculan effort to pull it off and requires a lot less of sitting on the computer and a lot more of going out and blocking the entire town We literally had to block the entire town and get permissions It was I don't recommend it anybody to do it again But a game is not just assets If you just stop at assets cool You're an asset library company But a game is more than that When I grew up playing games there were specific instances specific bosses that I remember fighting against that I still remember to today I carry those memories with me And I feel we have this responsibility right if we are making games to make characters and personalities that people carry for the rest of their lives as a memory So we wanted to come up with the best story the best game design And while I can't spoil too much of the story we actually put a lot of effort in coming up with a story that everybody will resonate with A story that where you start with you know where most of us are in life and then go through the quest not for strength directly but for wisdom first and then for strength Kind of like my life I had to take a pit stop at the wisdom you know restaurant to then be able to carry on with my life and gain strength and power right I think that should be true for everybody And the game not only is an excellent combat experience based on Sakiro the combat systems we've also built a lot of things from scratch that make it uniquely Indian and uniquely something that doesn't exist on the game stores today in any game store because it's just the way we thought about this The approach that we have is a complete outsider approach So it feels and looks different It will feel a lot different from everything else that hopefully has come in the past And it's not it just doesn't even end there It's almost like a never- ending project right We had to put in so much time and effort actually doing animations So you can take a look at some of the mocap BTS that we have here Uh it's a lot of sitting in suits The animations from the suits aren't perfect So you need human animators You need real people who are going in there and exaggerating the effects a little bit making sure it looks real It's a lot of effort And I know I've said that a million times but if you knew how much effort this was going in and how much money it would cost we probably wouldn't do it right But it is what it is Foolishness is important for you to get in But once you get in I feel like now we've just made so much more progress than than everything that exists So there's a lot of manual effort that's gone into this But lastly in order to make those combat systems I spoke about in order to make the gameplay feel very responsive in order to create our own behavior trees uh and not have to rely just on the Unreal Engine ones to make ours goal directed we had to write an obscene amount of C++ You know there's this thing that game developers say uh when front-end engineers talk about performance issues we call them jokes All of us call them jokes because we just feel like the amount of effort every strand of hair we need to worry about right Every every single vertex we need to be like that's too much We got to worry about it Number of characters in a scene we got to worry about it So I really feel like there's a lot of optimization work that we had to do And I need to come back to the idea that even after you do all of this even after you figure out all the programmatic parts there's still so much manual effort Like I want to show you a picture of an auto straight from a scan that we had to fix or clean up It's just so much hellish work You can look at these fruits that we had to sit and manually clean up It's just a lot of work right And parts of the scans are missing Like this just I mentioned this like 50 times but it was a lot of work And I'm glad that we reached this end of the tunnel where the game is actually 60 70% done And now from here to where it goes I think it's a lot easier because we've already processed so many assets We've already fixed so many assets Uh there's a huge number of modelers on this Like I mentioned there's 40 people on the team So before I move any further I want to quickly talk about the team because this is not a indie shop where it's just one or two people doing it It's a large team working on it Maybe not the size of most AAA companies but we do feel that most of those AAA companies are still you know using old flows right They're not they've not moved to photoggramometry as yet because they haven't figured out it's gotten good in the last 6 8 months They haven't kept track of this space and they're mid project So it's hard for them to switch out So they will become smaller over time too And I feel like size when you're that big when you're 100 people it's a little bit hard At 40 people I think we have just the right size We're still hiring another 20 25 people There's still a lot more work left to do But I quickly want to introduce you to the team So on the programming side the person leading it is Rishi Rishi has extensive experience building a lot of games by himself He's actually very young but he's built a lot of games by himself And he's also built a game engine even before he walked into these halls And now he's written hundreds of thousands of lines of C++ and it's just been it's just been a treat to watch He's built a lot of systems from scratch and you guys will enjoy playing the game I hope you guys enjoy playing the game as much as he enjoyed building it Next we have Davi who is actually from Think Tank which is one of the number one schools for game development and VFX across the world Uh if you go to Think Tank's website you can see some of the work she's made and she's a great 3D artist who likes working with her hands who likes building things from scratch and you'll see a lot of her assets in the game Then we have Suge who's who goes by Hansy Sujay and Su has worked on an extensive range of titles from Hogwarts Legacy to Horizon Forbidden West to even go to Sushima So SU has got seven years of experience doing character modeling We needed someone senior there someone who's an artist who has an eye for all of these things and so has just done a fantastic job Right The entire pipeline both the photoggramometry as well as the handmade pipeline is both run by him Uh then we have Krishna who is the animator from Ant-Man quantum Krishna has actually worked on Ant-Man quantum mania So you've seen Ant-Man quantum mania you've probably seen his work So we have him actually going in fixing the animations thinking about how the cinematic should be structured So it is a pretty good team Then we have Din whose you know experience and credits who used to work at Dag but his experience and credits include films like Mickey 17 and Aquaman I think that every India already had the latent demand or the latent need desire to actually go out and make a game It's not we didn't have a skill issue ever right I thought I think it's mostly the fact that we just didn't have either the courage or the ability to put things together or the ability to see the grand vision the ability to spend so much Um and of course without photogometry this will have to be a much larger team So a much bigger undertaking So I just feel that uh I'm so glad these guys decided to come do this with us We spoke to so many 3D modelers who said ""Oh no but this is good but I still"" even though we were paying we were offering more they were like ""Oh but I I want to go work at this bigname 3D you know I want to go work at a big name outsourcing shop in India right"" So it's very hard to get people to take a risk and I understand why but uh I'm so glad these people took a risk Then we have Pari who even though Pari doesn't have big titles to his name you can see some of his work online and he's done an extensive amount of work and Par was the hardest worker because he had to catch up to the rest of the team So he's done an excellent job at cleaning up the photoggramometry scans and leading that team and making sure that you know the assets that come out in the levels and the set dressing that come out in some of the levels that you saw in the trailer and some of what you'll see on the website he's put in a lot of effort there And it's almost like when you're playing catchup you're like I want to be as good as the best and he always had the potential He's always worked by himself for years and now finally he get the opportunity to to take it to the world And then of course the person running AOS games because I do AOS and my job is to keep looking for the next interesting thing that we can potentially be the best at spend 6 8 10 months in this case probably 2 years spearheading the first good product back then it was the first few good videos set the process but the CEO of this company is Rohan who's my brother who is XY combinator and we made games before we've always spoken about making games we made overpowered card game last year uh which is probably defunct now but before that we've made you know small games that we used to constantly have fun doing we built something called Mumbai make harda many years ago you can find it on itio IO uh we always wanted to make a game We knew it was very expensive We knew that the potential ROI of this is zero Uh but someone's got to try and so glad he's leading this because I can really count on him So there are a few more people I want to talk about One of them is Vishal who used to run this VFX cinematics firm called 20s He's done a fantastic job of uh sort of making cinematics for clients with VFX And when we gave him the shot at making cinematics for the game in engine he said ""This is going to this is a dream and I would love to do this"" So he's done a fantastic job So you've seen some of his work in the trailer You'll probably you know you you'll see some of his work online And as time goes by as we leak more things you'll probably see some more of it And then finally we have who's helped us with a lot of the coordination And then apart from this core team we have a huge team actually sitting down doing cleanup doing art doing modeling who all sit between below the people that I've spoke about so far And of course there are people who are not directly involved but sort of involved which is we have so many people here at AOS who are actually helping us with things like audio like we find the right person because we've got video and content people here So audio audio mixing video We have so many people here that are helpful And uh yeah I just want to say that at this point we know 100% of how to make a super high quality game Like we think we can hit the global benchmark and this is iteratively going to keep getting better because 3 months ago if you saw where it was some of the people that saw the demos they thought it was good but now it's even better and it's going to keep getting better as we infuse more of India as we make it more Bollywood style It'll be very unique Nobody would seen a game like this And yes we're going to try to get it on PC and consoles We'll figure out in what order and you know we'll figure out all those things later Um but we are also humble enough to know that nobody can predict success We can try we can give it our best shot but nobody can predict success uh financial success but we think we know how to make it We think we know the entire sequence of things We know how much effort it takes We know exactly how much it costs at this point We won't breathe easy till it's done So ladies and gentlemen that was Lean It's called Unleash the Avatar It'll come fall of next year 2026 And I'm so honored that we were able to do it I can't leak too much about the story but uh but you'll find out details soon enough The best thing you can do is really share this I know that making a game is too expensive for most people or it's too hard to put all these things together or you know skills might be a challenge and we're always hiring if if you are skilled and you want a shot at this but we do think the ways to supporters are really sharing it far and wide The hard part is not building things anymore even with a game Sure it's very very difficult and we've we've moved a lot of things to make it happen but it's also about getting enough of the reach That's why I had to spend so much time hyping this because the project's risk is so high that if we don't get enough exposure then and this doesn't go to the markets where it matters like the US and Canada and places like that then we probably don't have enough of a shot of being a financial success which is which means I lose all my money I'm a bootstrap company so it is financially stressful but u I'm hoping you help us with that Anyway thanks for tuning in Bye",

Now, they'll have to pay the AI a lot, so they won't capture all of that. And also, the market price for a piece of code will go down, but I I would bet this is an example.

I don't want to like dodge the question cuz I don't think it'll be like that in every industry, but code is one where I would guess it's like that. Now that we know everything we know, do you have a timeline for when a lot of writing code becomes English or is that not going to happen? I think it's the degree of automation that matters. is to get to a truly 100% automation. You can make a complex thing and never touch code.

havXLji16Vs,"Scientists REVIVED Dire Wolf After 10,000 YEARS!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=havXLji16Vs,"Scientists just deextincted the dire wolf. If you're a Game of Thrones fan, this sounds like fantasy becoming reality, and it is. Colossal Biosciences, a company dedicated to genetic engineering and de-extinction projects, has successfully brought back dire wolves after being extinct for over 10,000 years. [Music] Now, these ancient predators were reconstructed using DNA from fossils dating back 11,500 and 72,000 years. Technically, Colossal used crisper gene editing to recreate the genome, bridging the gap between ancient samples and modern wolves. The project has already resulted in three dire wolves with distinctive thick white fur that showcases characteristics scientists couldn't determine from fossils alone. Colossal's mission goes beyond reviving extinct species. It's about taking responsibility for Earth's biodiversity. As the company's CEO, Ben Lamb, explained on Joe Rogan's podcast, they're not just focused on dire wolves. They're also working on woolly mammoths, Tasmanian tigers, and the dodo. They even created woolly mice as a proof of concept, which went viral online because they were unexpectedly adorable. But this raises fascinating questions about deextinction. Which species should we bring back? Could this technology help wildlife conservation?

38JY55cby7Q,Sam Altman on the future of design jobs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38JY55cby7Q,"You know, in our own company, we have a bunch of people who are video editors, people who are designers.

And no doubt it's going to change the workflow of a graphic designer and some things that some people were paid for, they won't be paid for those tasks. Taste still really matters. You know, when we went from had graphic designers had to do everything with like uh paper and pencil or to having computer tools, they were able to do more and do better, but we still needed a lot of good graphic design in the world. So, there will still be people that are in charge of, you know, making a website look great. But the expectations of how good a website looks just go up a lot and we all get better stuff. Maybe there are fewer people that do that, but they make much more money. And maybe there are more people that do it because we just have a, you know, explosion of how many websites we can get.

xFvlUVkMPJY,"Sam Altman On Miyazaki’s thoughts on art, Design Jobs, Indian AI, Is Prompt Engineering A Job?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFvlUVkMPJY,"Ladies and gentlemen, I'm with Sam Alman. And Sam, uh, I've seen a bunch of your tweets over the last few days. They're called posts now. They're called X's now. I don't know what they're called anymore. I don't know what they're called. I still call them tweets. You've been tweeting a lot about India. You've also been tweeting a lot about the new image gen. Firstly, I want to say I've had early access to the the photo image gen thing. It's been great. Everything from mood boarding, making images, UI, it's just been phenomenal. In fact, it's also very smart. So we've been we have this very clever use case where we're generating the front view of a 3D model and then asking it for the left side view, the right side view, the view behind and then we're throwing that into you know another model that generates the mesh and then reproing these textures on top and then also asking it to generate height maps which is just the insanity of this existing where it didn't exist a couple of months ago is just it it's it blows my mind. What's the response been like? Any numbers for us? I I don't know if I can share an exact number but like way more images than I thought the internet had uh like appetite to to do like the um we will cross a billion total images in the notistant future. I can say that. Oh man, that that's a huge number. And what's the response like any any creative use cases that you've seen on on images so far apart from you know animating yourself? Yeah, I I mean the the thing that's been exciting to me is just the breadth of creative use cases. Obviously turning yourself into anime was the one that kind of first lit up on the internet, but but it's been amazing to see the sort of creative expression, people making just really new kinds of images I had never thought about before. Um there's obviously a lot of great commercial use cases too where people are, you know, using this in their small business for new logos or graphic design or whatever. But but really the creative spirit of people just doing things that, you know, images, kinds of images that I've never seen exist before, that's that's been to me quite exciting. And and has India contributed? I mean I think India has been a big user of this from your tweets at least. India I I believe is our fastest growing market now. Um India's been been very special to us for a long time. Um India was one of the first markets outside the US that really jumped on AI in a huge huge way and since this moment has happened it is now our I'm pretty sure it's our fastest growing market. Wow. That's that's that's so it's been very cool to see. That's crazy too. And and have you seen Indians also use things outside of imagen? Have you seen them use deep research? Are they a paying market? Uh I was in India a couple of months ago and the that was obviously before image genen and you know it was like non-stop stories from people about what they were using chatbt for um what what they were using chatbt to do not catch 40. Um but but it was really it's like quite incredible the degree to which it has permeated Indian society for for all sorts of things. You know certainly we get feedback that our price point is too high for mass adoption in the Indian market and we're looking at things to do there. Unfortunately, our compute costs are still just quite high. But we are hard at work on more efficient models and I'm optimistic we'll be able to bring cost down over time. Amazing. And I want to touch upon the other side of this, right, which is the UI and design jobs for a second. You know, we thought when these tools come out came out a year ago that well, we're going to have, you know, these tools do most of the work for us. But, you know, in our own company, we have a bunch of people who are video editors. We have people who are designers and it turns out we still need a person to run the tool because humans still need accountability someone maintaining context and it's almost like the manager of the tool in some senses right uh is this how is this how jobs are going to evolve is have you seen something similar or do you have a do you have a path for how jobs will evolve now that these sort of tools are here I think it's going to be uneven and it'll be different for different kinds of jobs there will be some jobs that are that totally go away where the AI just does them end to And mostly I think it'll be a case of a new tool where people are just much more productive and can do work at a higher quality. So there will still be people that are in charge of you know making a website look great. But the expectations of how good a website looks just go up a lot and we all get better stuff. Uh in fact maybe we get more maybe there's more demand for that in a world like that that that I think can cut many different ways. Um and then there will be totally new classes of jobs that we just haven't seen before at all. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have examples so far? There are some kinds of customer support where I think an AI can just do that end to end and that'd be in the first category. In the second, since we're on this example of graphic designers, you know, taste still really matters and like the the you know, when we went from graphic designers had to do everything with like uh paper and pencil or you know, pens and paper, whatever you want to call it, to having computer tools, they were able to do more and do better, but we still needed a lot of good graphic design in the world. Um, we can now have a new tool, but and and no doubt it's going to change the workflow of a graphic designer and some things that some people were paid for, they won't be paid for those tasks. But what it appears to me will happen is you will still need some sort of job, which is, you know, make this website look beautiful. Um, and maybe there are fewer people that do that, but they make much more money. Maybe there are more people that do it because we just have a, you know, explosion of how many websites we can get. Like may maybe it turns out there was way more demand for graphic design in the world than than we could sort of like afford to fill. I think we just don't know on that yet. Um, and then there's other and then in terms of like entirely new jobs, you know, the first example we saw of that was prompt engineer. Before AI came along, there was no such thing as a prompt engineer. Not only that, there was no it would have been hard to conceptualize that there would be such a job. Um there's there's many more, but that's the example I give is the sort of near and dear to my heart one. And it's so funny when whenever some of these new jobs come in, they're always ridiculed at first, right? Like even building rappers, and we'll come to that in a bit, but even with prompt engineer, a lot of people still don't take it seriously. Well, all you're going to do is write English. Do you have a do you have a defense for that? Do you feel there's there's some way to, you know, make the people who are now going to be prompt engineers feel a little more, you know, like they're not losing status for doing it? When I was young, um, I knew I wanted to go study computer programming. And the adults in my life would say, ""Oh, that's like that's a hobby job. These computers aren't going to go anywhere. You need to go be a doctor or a lawyer. Like, you need to get a real stable job."" You know, this is like a this is a dangerous path to go down. Um, and I thought I understood something that they didn't. And I think I really encourage people to have their own conviction on what things are going to be like. And just because something is not a just because something is not a historically valuable or high status job doesn't mean it won't be in the future. Um this is this is like the way of technological progress. You know for people that are watching there's a post by Sam Alman on this which is the strength to be misunderstood. I love that that blog post by the way. So thank you so much for that. You wrote it many years ago. I think it was it was very insightful when I decided to become a content creator and it was a low status job back then. I was going to say about your job, you know, I remember, you know, like 10 years ago or something. Uh, I would like I would meet people I I was, you know, I would go talk about doing startups or whatever and I I would like go meet young people who wanted to start startups. And I always kind of like asked people what they wanted to be or what they thought the interesting industries were because I think if you kind of like ask young people that you get a you get a perspective that is interesting and different and usually right. And every not everybody many people said they wanted to be a YouTuber at the time. I was like what? But I I it hit me then that I'm like ah I cannot dismiss this like people dismissed computer programmer when I was young. Yeah. I I want to touch upon something else that the internet's been sort of debating over the last few days which is you know there's this video of Miyazaki. So of course it's an out of context video where he's looking at a model from you know many years ago something some creature thrashing around and he said that well you know I don't like this. Essentially that was the the you know the summary of what he said. you know, as an artist who's been making videos for n 9 years, I feel some of the craft and the, you know, the effort I'd have to put in to make an image or even to make a video has dropped over the years. And it is a little bit upsetting. It it feels like it's a little bit of a bummer as an artist, right? But as an entrepreneur, as somebody now that has a team to manage and worry about their salaries and payroll and whatnot, it is very good that this technology exists because it helps me go a little bit faster, right? It helps me, you know, make sure that I'm I'm dealing with a lot a lot less stress. Do you have a view on um, you know, how the internet should think about this evolving nature of art? I think what it was like to try to um do what you do 30 years ago. It was impossible or very hard. I mean, you'd need like a camcorder and like VHS tapes and then you'd have to like edit it in some complicated way. And then even if you did that, you would have to like distribute tapes because there was no internet and no YouTube or there wasn't internet but it wasn't very good. And now like anybody on earth can get a smartphone and record themselves and put it up and if they have something interesting to say they get it out there and the world benefits from that. Um I think the democratization of creating content has been a big netwin for society. It has not been a complete win. There are negative things about it for sure and certainly it did something about the the art form but I think on the whole it's been a win and this is something that I very deeply believe about the power of technology which is giving everyone more tools making things easier lowering the barriers to entry um does significantly increase the number of people that can contribute to society and we all benefit from that overall. Doesn't mean that it doesn't like cause some job loss and some people who had a sort of differential ability to do something now have a lot more competition, but overall I think it's a real benefit to society. Um my own experience of this was watching the barrier to entry to starting a company really change. Um, this happened when it got cheaper to start a company because of a whole bunch of things, but AWS was one of the biggest and most important moments. Access to the internet in general was was another big one. And there was a shift that Y Combinator I think really helped drive or popularize whatever you want to call it. uh starting in 2005 where young technical founders could all of a sudden much more easily start companies and that led to an explosion of great new products and technologies that the world got to benefit from. Now some of the people that those companies competed with probably wish that hadn't happened but as a citizen of the world there was a lot more stuff. OpenAI itself, I think, was an example of a company that only got to happen because the barriers to entry to a bunch of different pieces of technology stack got significantly low and this ragtag bunch of us were able to just do something we had no right to do. Yeah, I think I agree with you. I think especially after Stripe and in India after UPI, there's just been an explosion of new companies, new new types of things that were just not possible because the amount of red tape that it required to even get started. I assume now it's sort of become the same in design. In fact, on the note of YC, right, I actually, you know, I want to ask you to put on your 20-year-old when you were a 20-year-old hat of, you know, going to YC again. If you knew everything you knew right now and the debate was, you should build a rapper or no, you shouldn't build a rapper, OpenAI would probably kill your startup or on the other side, foundational models are worthless. Rappers are the only ones that are making money and able to raise money and whatnot. Um, what would you do knowing everything you knew, but also with the ability to shut out the noise? I think the whole like oh your startup is just a rapper or oh like people used to say that about other categories too. You know there was a time when people say well you're just a rapper on AWS probably. Um the people are building absolutely incredible new companies based off of AI. Most of them will fail or not do that well, but some of them will find a really enduring business and generate a ton of value. And that's that's always the case. That's just how the world work. Like, you know, most startups fail and some really succeed. And it's easy to sound smart and to just dismiss everything as a rapper or some thin thing that's not going to, you know, create much value. And I remember when people used to say very similar things about open AAI. Yeah. What was it? What was the they used to say? You're just, you know, you're just like a little research lab and Google's going to crush you and like you're just putting this like thin layer on or Nvidia is going to get all the value or you're going to like you're doing this like little thing and it's impossible to compete with the big tech companies. And it was not long ago they were saying this. This is a couple years ago. So I don't know. I it sounds very cool and sophisticated to always say why things aren't going to work and you will be right most of the time. Um and kind of the the most important lesson I think you can learn as an entrepreneur is that that or an investor is that that is not how great companies get built or invested in. So I think if I were 20 in NYC right now and someone was calling my company a GPT rapper, I'd be like, ""Ah, I'm I must be, you know, in a promising direction."" Do you do you have any specific ideas that you would be working on if you were 20? But you were not an open AI, you didn't have the resources. You had 500K. As a matter of principle, I try to never answer that question because I I the thing I care about most is that people don't start someone else's company. Like you you the ideas that I have for companies are probably mid at best. And the idea that some 20-year-old doing YC right now that has a company that has an idea for a company that sounds totally crazy and bad to me, that's probably the next open AI. And I never want to discourage anyone from that by saying some like safe middle of the road like out of touch idea. So go do your crazy idea. It's my advice. That makes sense. It's almost like you need to do what you're passionate about. Otherwise, you never end up building a Snapchat because everyone would think it was a bad idea on day one. Um, that's amazing, Sam. You know, we did a we did a podcast with Kevin, uh, your CPO the other day, and he gave me a timeline for when code is going to be automated. He said 2025. Anthropic said 2027. He said, ""No, we can do better. We'll do 2025 or maybe 2026."" Um, now that we know everything we know, do you have a timeline for when, you know, a lot of writing code becomes English? or is that not going to happen? I think it's the degree of automation that matters to get to 100 truly 100% automation. You know, you can make a complex thing and never touch code. That that's one thing, but I'm less interested in that question than when a coder becomes 10 times more productive. And I think that could happen this year, next year, something like that. So, a coder is 10x more productive. I think a coder is already several times more productive. I think there's already like at least in you know the way people around me have started working the good ones who've adopted the yeah people maybe say 2x 3x but I haven't heard anyone I haven't heard many people I have not heard a consensus for 10x yet but you think that by next year it's going to be a a 10x step function look predictions especially predictions with the timeline attached are always difficult but I think we can aim at that yeah interesting you know there's there is a negative side to this right which is that you know Daniel Grath had this this one article where he said that $250 billion of India's exports are actually IT services and if you think from that angle that could just be GBD4 tokens right or GDP5 tokens at some point for India that $250 billion is very important and not all of those engineers are building are are elite engineers who will benefit from this technology and go 10x right some of them are still building simple crab crowd apps and there is competition from the 10x engineer maybe not from AI itself but an engineer using the AI and sort of outpacing them and It's they're able to do this at much cheaper, right? Because the tokens are of course cheaper. Do you have something that India can do uh to actually make sure we absorb some of that? We we continue to be relevant there. If there's one area that I think I think this is an important general question, but if there's one area where I think that the world just has so much more demand than we can currently supply, it's for codewritten. My my belief is that the world just wants way more software and is about to get it. And if you give people these tools to write software much more effectively, I at least think for a while what will happen is someone who today can write code at some value will be able to write code or create software let's say at some much higher value. Now they have to pay the AI a lot so they won't capture all of that. Um and also the market price for a piece of code will go down. But I I would bet this is an example. Everyone seems obsessed with Jevans paradox all of a sudden and I would bet this will be an example of it. So a lot more software being built. So this it might it might the cost might drop a certain amount but then also demand goes up by that amount. I think so. Interesting. That's very reassuring to hear actually. I don't think it's going to be like that. I don't I don't want to like dodge the question because I don't think it'll be like that in every industry but code is one where I would guess it's like that. And and do you see a lot of these I mean we've been seeing sort of early agents right? We've seen deep research. D research has been great but DP is also a passive agent. It's not taking my card and doing something with it. So there's there's low DP research is low risk. Um I've seen that you have been very bullish about agents. There are lots of businesses that have been very bullish about lots of other companies that have been bullish about agents. Um do you have do you have something in mind for what agents will become over the end of this year or by by next year and some use cases that you think we'll see on an everyday basis with agents? Just to stick with the code example because we're on that. I I think this idea that you can like say to a coding agent um I would like this new feature built and it goes off and pings you back you know some period of time later and says okay here's the pull request ready to go that I think will feel very crazy to people there's other categories where it kind of goes off and does stuff for you on the internet operator points at that a little bit um but I would expect the coding one to be a big a big anything on a consumer use case like something like booking your your food or something ordering a cab or something like that. That's the kind of thing that I very much expect to happen and that that'll feel like a very agentic task. Let me ask you another question which is if you were an employee at a job but you were working at a legacy company let's say they were slow to adopt all this technology they're not even aware that you know maybe they've tried it in passing they've seen a GPD3 and they've become dismissive about and lots of legacy companies are like this if you were sitting in that company and you were unable to convince your company to use these new tools because of bureaucracy or whatever reason would you what would your career plan be then would you move to a faster moving company but also you know take on the risk of that company probably I would do that. Yeah. Both because I think companies that don't adopt these things will be in a tough place. Most I mean, there's some categories of companies that of course be fine, but also because I'd want to be responsible for my own career success and I'd want to make sure I was learning and you know, if I felt like I was not getting exposure to these tools, it would seem super broken. That makes sense. Okay, one last question and then we should be good. Um, can you give me a counterintuitive insight you've had about AI? worked here for a very long time of your life and you've done a bunch of things. You've done YC where you've invested in companies. You've you've you've been around the valley for a very long period of time. What is something you thought about AI but you have a totally different experience now? I somehow thought it was going to be a bigger change to society than it's turned out to be. Um, you know, I I I I had this sort of like sci-fi like vision of what AI was going to be like. And maybe it'll still get there, but right now it's just this like crazy powerful tool. And life goes on mostly the same. And and I'm actually very happy about that. I think that's good. I think I was naive before. I also think that would have been bad. But it's it it's very different than I kind of imagined it 10 years ago. But I think I think that's wonderful. Yeah, I think that's wonderful, too. I think you know having godlike technology being able to solve at some point medicine and help us do less of the work we hate but more of the work we enjoy I think is is is net good and I hope that you know everyone benefits from it at some point. Um thank you Sam. Uh this was this was a wonderful interview. Thank you so much for being support and and doing this you know on such short notice and I hope uh I hope you know India continues to use this technology and I I have no doubt I I I what is happening with this technology in India I I have uh I've never seen adoption like this of anything anywhere and it's very cool. Yeah, I really hope we do more of that and I hope you know we put it all over the timeline and and you know you see some of the things we you created. Thank you. Awesome. Thanks Sam. Bye.","Ladies and gentlemen I'm with Sam Alman And Sam uh I've seen a bunch of your tweets over the last few days They're called posts now They're called X's now I don't know what they're called anymore I don't know what they're called I still call them tweets You've been tweeting a lot about India You've also been tweeting a lot about the new image gen Firstly I want to say I've had early access to the the photo image gen thing It's been great Everything from mood boarding making images UI it's just been phenomenal In fact it's also very smart So we've been we have this very clever use case where we're generating the front view of a 3D model and then asking it for the left side view the right side view the view behind and then we're throwing that into you know another model that generates the mesh and then reproing these textures on top and then also asking it to generate height maps which is just the insanity of this existing where it didn't exist a couple of months ago is just it it's it blows my mind What's the response been like Any numbers for us I I don't know if I can share an exact number but like way more images than I thought the internet had uh like appetite to to do like the um we will cross a billion total images in the notistant future I can say that Oh man that that's a huge number And what's the response like any any creative use cases that you've seen on on images so far apart from you know animating yourself Yeah I I mean the the thing that's been exciting to me is just the breadth of creative use cases Obviously turning yourself into anime was the one that kind of first lit up on the internet but but it's been amazing to see the sort of creative expression people making just really new kinds of images I had never thought about before Um there's obviously a lot of great commercial use cases too where people are you know using this in their small business for new logos or graphic design or whatever But but really the creative spirit of people just doing things that you know images kinds of images that I've never seen exist before that's that's been to me quite exciting And and has India contributed I mean I think India has been a big user of this from your tweets at least India I I believe is our fastest growing market now Um India's been been very special to us for a long time Um India was one of the first markets outside the US that really jumped on AI in a huge huge way and since this moment has happened it is now our I'm pretty sure it's our fastest growing market Wow That's that's that's so it's been very cool to see

are building absolutely incredible new companies based off of AI Most of them will fail or not do that well but some of them will find a really enduring business and generate a ton of value And that's that's always the case That's just how the world work Like you know most startups fail and some really succeed And it's easy to sound smart and to just dismiss everything as a rapper or some thin thing that's not going to you know create much value And I remember when people used to say very similar things about open AAI Yeah What was it What was the they used to say You're just you know you're just like a little research lab and Google's going to crush you and like you're just putting this like thin layer on or Nvidia is going to get all the value or you're going to like you're doing this like little thing and it's impossible to compete with the big tech companies And it was not long ago they were saying this This is a couple years ago So I don't know I it sounds very cool and sophisticated to always say why things aren't going to work and you will be right most of the time Um and kind of the the most important lesson I think you can learn as an entrepreneur is that that or an investor is that that is not how great companies get built or invested in So I think if I were 20 in NYC right now and someone was calling my company a GPT rapper I'd be like ""Ah I'm I must be you know in a promising direction"" Do you do you have any specific ideas that you would be working on if you were 20 But you were not an open AI you didn't have the resources You had 500K As a matter of principle I try to never answer that question because I I the thing I care about most is that people don't start someone else's company Like you you the ideas that I have for companies are probably mid at best And the idea that some 20-year-old doing YC right now that has a company that has an idea for a company that sounds totally crazy and bad to me that's probably the next open AI And I never want to discourage anyone from that by saying some like safe middle of the road like out of touch idea So go do your crazy idea It's my advice That makes sense It's almost like you need to do what you're passionate about Otherwise you never end up building a Snapchat because everyone would think it was a bad idea on day one Um that's amazing Sam You know we did a we did a podcast with Kevin uh your CPO the other day and he gave me a timeline for when code is going to be automated He said 2025 Anthropic said 2027 He said ""No we can do better We'll do 2025 or maybe 2026"" Um now that we know everything we know do you have a timeline for when you know a lot of writing code becomes English or is that not going to happen I think it's the degree of automation that matters to get to 100 truly 100% automation You know you can make a complex thing and never touch code That that's one thing but I'm less interested in that question than when a coder becomes 10 times more productive And I think that could happen this year next year something like that So a coder is 10x more productive I think a coder is already several times more productive I think there's already like at least in you know the way people around me have started working the good ones who've adopted the yeah people maybe say 2x 3x but I haven't heard anyone I haven't heard many people I have not heard a consensus for 10x yet but you think that by next year it's going to be a a 10x step function look predictions especially predictions with the timeline attached are always difficult but I think we can aim at that yeah interesting you know there's there is a negative side to this right which is that you know Daniel Grath had this this one article where he said that $250 billion of India's exports are actually IT services and if you think from that angle that could just be GBD4 tokens right or GDP5 tokens at some point for India that $250 billion is very important and not all of those engineers are building are are elite engineers who will benefit from this technology and go 10x right some of them are still building simple crab crowd apps and there is competition from the 10x engineer maybe not from AI itself but an engineer using the AI and sort of outpacing them and It's they're able to do this at much cheaper right Because the tokens are of course cheaper Do you have something that India can do uh to actually make sure we absorb some of that We we continue to be relevant there If there's one area that I think I think this is an important general question but if there's one area where I think that the world just has so much more demand than we can currently supply it's for codewritten My my belief is that the world just wants way more software and is about to get it And if you give people these tools to write software much more effectively I at least think for a while what will happen is someone who today can write code at some value will be able to write code or create software let's say at some much higher value Now they have to pay the AI a lot so they won't capture all of that Um and also the market price for a piece of code will go down But I I would bet this is an example Everyone seems obsessed with Jevans paradox all of a sudden and I would bet this will be an example of it So a lot more software being built So this it might it might the cost might drop a certain amount but then also demand goes up by that amount I think so Interesting That's very reassuring to hear actually I don't think it's going to be like that I don't I don't want to like dodge the question because I don't think it'll be like that in every industry but code is one where I would guess it's like that And and do you see a lot of these I mean we've been seeing sort of early agents right We've seen deep research D research has been great but DP is also a passive agent It's not taking my card and doing something with it So there's there's low DP research is low risk Um I've seen that you have been very bullish about agents There are lots of businesses that have been very bullish about lots of other companies that have been bullish about agents Um do you have do you have something in mind for what agents will become over the end of this year or by by next year and some use cases that you think we'll see on an everyday basis with agents Just to stick with the code example because we're on that I I think this idea that you can like say to a coding agent um I would like this new feature built and it goes off and pings you back you know some period of time later and says okay here's the pull request ready to go that I think will feel very crazy to people there's other categories where it kind of goes off and does stuff for you on the internet operator points at that a little bit um but I would expect the coding one to be a big a big anything on a consumer use case like something like booking your your food or something ordering a cab or something like that That's the kind of thing that I very much expect to happen and that that'll feel like a very agentic task Let me ask you another question which is if you were an employee at a job but you were working at a legacy company let's say they were slow to adopt all this technology they're not even aware that you know maybe they've tried it in passing they've seen a GPD3 and they've become dismissive about and lots of legacy companies are like this if you were sitting in that company and you were unable to convince your company to use these new tools because of bureaucracy or whatever reason would you what would your career plan be then would you move to a faster moving company but also you know take on the risk of that company probably I would do that Yeah Both because I think companies that don't adopt these things will be in a tough place Most I mean there's some categories of companies that of course be fine but also because I'd want to be responsible for my own career success and I'd want to make sure I was learning and you know if I felt like I was not getting exposure to these tools it would seem super broken That makes sense Okay one last question and then we should be good Um can you give me a counterintuitive insight you've had about AI worked here for a very long time of your life and you've done a bunch of things You've done YC where you've invested in companies You've you've you've been around the valley for a very long period of time What is something you thought about AI but you have a totally different experience now I somehow thought it was going to be a bigger change to society than it's turned out to be Um you know I I I I had this sort of like sci-fi like vision of what AI was going to be like And maybe it'll still get there but right now it's just this like crazy powerful tool And life goes on mostly the same And and I'm actually very happy about that I think that's good I think I was naive before I also think that would have been bad But it's it it's very different than I kind of imagined it 10 years ago But I think I think that's wonderful Yeah I think that's wonderful too I think you know having godlike technology being able to solve at some point medicine and help us do less of the work we hate but more of the work we enjoy I think is is is net good and I hope that you know everyone benefits from it at some point Um thank you Sam Uh this was this was a wonderful interview Thank you so much for being support and and doing this you know on such short notice and I hope uh I hope you know India continues to use this technology and I I have no doubt I I I what is happening with this technology in India I I have uh I've never seen adoption like this of anything anywhere and it's very cool Yeah I really hope we do more of that and I hope you know we put it all over the timeline and and you know you see some of the things we you created Thank you Awesome Thanks Sam Bye",

You've also been tweeting a lot about the new image gen. It blows my mind. What's the response been like? I I don't know if I can share an exact number, but like way more images than I thought the internet had. What is happening with this technology in India? I've never seen adoption like this of anything anywhere. And it's very cool. Do you have a path for how jobs will evolve now that these sort of tools are here? There will be some jobs that totally go away where the AI just does them end to end and then there will be totally new classes of jobs that we just haven't seen before at all. Or do you have a timeline for when you know a lot of writing code becomes English or is that not going to happen? I'm less interested in that question than when a coder becomes 10 times more productive and I think that could happen this year. You know there's this video of Miyazaki.

5SV8-qVm9S4,This AI Study Method Outperformed 80% of Traditional Education (And It&#39;s Getting Better),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SV8-qVm9S4,"A recent study revealed that students in Nigeria learned 2 years worth of material in just 6 weeks when using AI. What's crazy is that this AI assisted learning outperformed 80% of other educational programs and helped struggling students catch up. And it didn't stop there. The more sessions students attended, the greater their gains turned out to be. What's even more surprising is that these improvements weren't temporary. Students who participated in this 6E program continued to excel even in their end ofear exams, performing better across all subjects. But here's the challenge. While personalized learning is needed, in countries like India, only 57% of schools have a functional PC. That means millions of students are being left behind, especially now when AI is changing everything. And this isn't just about missing out on a device. It's about missing out on a 24/7 tutor that can provide instant explanations, real-time feedback, and personalized learning anytime, anywhere. For years, students have had to waste hours to understand concepts that could be explained in minutes, either by waiting for the next class or struggling through textbooks on their own. And while mobile devices can help, PCs are far better for practice. And that's where Intel's AI enabled PCs come in. Powered by Intel Core Ultra processors designed specially to handle the intensive processing AI requires, students can now run advanced AI models locally. Basically, they don't even need an internet connection to access this technology. So whether it's an 11 p.m. doubt, a quick last minute revision, or an extremely difficult question, help is right at their fingertips when they need it.

uaTfTikNe9w,I Spent 5 Days With The 0.0001% In A Secret City...,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaTfTikNe9w,"okay so most of my life I've hung out on the internet I was doing some math right I got an internet connection or dialup connection maybe when I was seven or 8 years old I've sat on MSN forums I've sat on Discord I've sat on X I've been on Reddit and it's just been a very long time but in the last one or two years something's changed because of the scale of that Avatar that we have which is this thing which we didn't expect to get so big but because of the scale of that and because our business has been getting bigger too I've been getting access to the top 0. 1% of the world which is phenomenal because now I can kind of see reality for what it is everyone is making it up as they go along even people who run the economy basically actually you can't predict the future but if you just say bro I don't know there are too many variables I can't make decisions and if I do this what will people say if it fails you can't really take decisions like that so a lot of these people they disagree with others sometimes but they still keep going on with their beliefs and they try to change the world by their actions not by waiting for other people to change the world everyone is sort of playing their role the most appropriate way to say this is that the world is a stage and everyone's kind of an actor everyone plays their role or fits into an unplayed role more than money which actually doesn't matter so much on the stage it is influence that matters influence over certain sectors of society over certain Fields over certain people the truth is every actor on the stage has an audience and combined the audiences everyone in the world all actors have their fans and haters once these actors s have influence they will make money and the thing I didn't realize is that most of the actors on stage know each other it's actually a small world on stage so the world economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland is like being backstage it's like peering behind the stage curtain and seeing what's really going on it's like walking on the street and being able to randomly walk into billionaires and celebrities and I was there and like a little spy with my meta aand glasses to show you what backstage really looks like cuz see as a content creator I'm really weird I can walk among the people backstage but I'm also more comfortable and I feel so much more at home with all of you all so like Deadpool this video is me breaking the fourth wall and showing you what actually happens and my learnings at the world economic Forum I'm breaking this video into five major learnings so here [Music] goes so I was invited by the YouTube team and I landed in Zurich and I was taken by a car to Davos now Davos has really tied security because of protesters when protesters realize that the world's most influential people are gathered together they try to protest and get their causes out there I think this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it sometimes the world's most influential are blind to certain topics and protests are a good way to get in front of them but they can also be severely disruptive if the things being protested are trivial anyway I had to wait one extra hour in the capab thanks to some protests going on also I forgot to mention it was really cold there was minus something and it was snowing I know this is not a related topic but I really like that weather but of course parts of my hands and face kept freezing so I was staying at the Google Alpine in like I told you YouTube had invited me and every major company and nation in the world has their own house that's right daos is full of houses Salesforce has their own house so does Intel and Qualcomm and India and even Africa during the day you can enter any house the houses also many of times have lodging so the house delegates don't have to find some other place to stay all the houses are designed very differently representing their brand colors and Vibe my favorite house was actually by palent there was these really cool LED strips which I'm definitely going to rip off that style I'm going to put some of those in our office then we went to get our badges I got a media badge which has decent levels of access across Davos you need to swipe your badge to get in in any place there are checkpoints all over now I spoke on a bunch of panels about AI plus content which we're pretty good at at this point at some of the houses that invited me but I didn't record any of it because the audience of the panels would see the white lights on the metari band so I really record uh we do over 400 million views a month across all our channels now many of them you don't even know about and over time we'll start learning which are the channels that we run and you'll come across them right but mainly my biggest learning at Davos especially with this is that this is some kind of big Fest where every faction or team has a house countries and big companies are kind of seen the same way and each house has Representatives it's like Harry Potter houses kind of right the second second learning is that a lot of big deals actually got done in Davos a Big Brand Clos and advertising deal with me there and the numbers are generally bigger I think everyone goes to daos in this Vibe of oh I'm here to close big deals or something like that right because you know other people are doing it you kind of get into a mood of also doing it I don't know it was kind of strange like India the country yes closed a lot of deals but they could have also closed those deals in India but believe it or not it's actually kind of convenient in Davos because the media is right outside the door you can walk to influential media people and say hey hey me and this person are closing this deal please go report on it and they report on it in India if you're sitting here you have to go through traditional channels people are busy you have to really think about the news cycle but there the media representatives are right outside I mean like I told you it's backstage people already know they're going to close a deal it's not like the deal happened there it's not like the decision- making happened there the closing the signing happened there no decisions are really made in Davos that is pred decided but the final sign is sometimes done there and reported there okay my third learning is that the parties suck at least the ones I went to when there's so much media nobody does anything I saw Mark Benny off the founder of Salesforce and he was just sitting in a place called Go's house with a bunch of people because see they also can't do stupid stuff because if you do stupid stuff the media will report on it nobody really does anything or maybe I just didn't find any insane stuff going on because I wasn't invited to any of those parties but I found it very boring just sitting and eating I mean especially the parts after the sessions right the nights and because you don't know the others it's basically like you're talking about basic stuff like what's the weather in your home place or something boring like that before we move on to the next part I want to share something that could help if you're hunting for a job as a fresher the demand for video editors is real and finding a good one is hard we have been fortunate in this case as we hire directly from A's video editing cohort almost all of the editors on my content team are from their cohort so if you are looking to break into video editing and work with creators like me check out their free editing master class and get a glimpse of their month intensive editing cohort that can help you land a job their recruitment network is 750 plus company strong so your odds of getting hired are high if you work hard the link is in the description now back to the video my next learning from Davos was about messaging four to 5 years ago and most of you don't know this I had this channel called Varun Maya level 2 i' made lots of very educational content on it we deep died into things like Unreal Engine right we did tutorials on it we did oops in Unreal Engine for example but notice how in the Unreal Engine series the first video has several thousand views but towards the end it has like 8090 views that's because everyone says they like super technical stuff but they don't the masses really get bored of it in the last year or so I stopped going too deep if you've noticed my content especially from a teaching front I've invested in companies that do it instead but me personally no the reason for this and what I learned at Davos again is that when you're on a stage and you have a large audience not everyone can understand everything when you're young you want validation from your PE so you get very technical about things but in places like Davos people speak more about broad goals like that event place I told you about the gos house in Go's house there are these banners that talk about un goals they are banners talking about broad goals right like no poverty zero hunger clean water sustainable cities these are very broad they aren't technical deep Dives right like in the zero hunger goal nobody's talking about hey use this very specific fertilizer to make crop growth better no they're talking about broad goals this is because people take back and remember only broad goals not the names of fertilizers the minute you get into specific fertilizers you get the equivalent of 80 to 90 views on my Unreal Engine content right low mental retention it's the same with my short form content I have so little time so we are being a little bit generic there it's what the mes want and if you don't get it that's actually you not understanding the world well and gos house is a good representation of it right go for the broader stuff don't get too deep dive unless you're making like a really long form video sometimes I get called out and cancel it for it saying oh you're not being technical anymore or whatever but that's okay it's the gos house phenomena it's important for you to learn also when you are communicating it's important to communicate the broad goals you want to achieve rather than specific advances unless someone is asking for specific advancements like if I was investing in your company I'd ask for specific things right how does this exactly work show me but otherwise for most busy people you're a turn off especially for the first conversation you get 80 to 90 [Music] views my last learning about Davos is about people I learned that the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the smartest they're not even the most hardworking they're actually just very good at taking risk and building relationships it's more courage than skill Jeff Bezos has that thing right there isn't a shortage of supply of Genius but there's definitely a shortage of supply of Courage so first before we get into courage let's talk about their distribution all the people in Davos have offline distribution in their phones they know maybe 50,000 people who can help them with anything they want they know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy most of you have 10 to 20 people in your life who can help you with things your friends in the last year what I saw happen to to me was my own Rolodex the contact called a Rolodex has gotten very large this is Now offline distribution I have some online distribution but also I've built up offline distribution some of the people at Davos can just call Prime Ministers and presidents of countries they very very well networked and have built strong relationships most of you what I've noticed at least on the internet fail at relationships young people are more likely to dunk on someone they don't know on social media for the attention of other young people in faceless accounts but the minute you say go out and meet people they don't do that because that requires work that requires energy that requires you having to maintain a conversation with your real face and your real voice in Davos I saw a lot of meetings happen that were just relationship building No Agenda just I want to get to know this person and maybe there's an opportunity 5 years later They're all playing the long game I'll give you an example one of my subsidiary companies AOS Labs so AOS is the company I run but there's a subsidiary we have called Labs that's done an AI project with Honeywell we've actually done something with the Bangalore City police with Honeywell so we're interfacing with Honeywell SAS platform with a voice too AI solution to to help automate some of these calls that the police gets anyway so what I did is I went there and met the CEO of Honeywell IIA where we spoke for a bit about the project just building a relationship right now the project's already in the PO stage so it's like Canal's involvement is going to end now but over the next let's say 2 years or 3 years I'm sure we'll do something else with them so that relationship matters the other part is about risks you can take risks when you have a lot of information and a lot of Davos is about information I know what new AI models and AI tools around the corner I know which ones are doing well and which ones are about to close large funding rounds I know which ones are doing badly because I hear it in the offline world right the companies investors I'll speak to it's it's just access to know what is working and what's not really working so I know the companies where they've closed the last funding ground but will be announced 6 months later it's so valuable to have this information before anybody else because we build on top of models right so it's so important to know what's working what can we catch 6 months later 8 months later as the underlying model gets better what we did with Avatar in some senses right so I keep sharing all of this on my YouTube so definitely do subscribe this is the same as when I entered Google deep Min getting access to information which is not out on the internet lowers your risk profile when trying new things so the parent company AOS literally our only job is to build distribution and keep trying experiments right and then we pass it on to a subsidiary as it gets big enough so all of this is very useful for us because it lowers my risk profile of trying new things well that's it I like Davos from the world economic Forum it's not some Illuminati something something going on where some crazy parties and you know people controlling everything it's not really that I thought it was fun I learned a lot seeing behind the curtain seeing backstage I think was really cool and I'll keep sharing more of these insights with you anyway until next time bye",okay so most of my life I've hung out on the internet I was doing some math right I got an internet connection or dialup connection maybe when I was seven or 8 years old I've sat on MSN forums I've sat on Discord I've sat on X I've been on Reddit and it's just been a very long time but in the last one or two years something's changed because of the scale of that Avatar that we have which is this thing which we didn't expect to get so big but because of the scale of that and because our business has been getting bigger too I've been getting access to the top 0 1% of the world which is phenomenal because now I can kind of see reality for what it is everyone is making it up as they go along even people who run the economy basically actually you can't predict the future but if you just say bro I don't know there are too many variables I can't make decisions and if I do this what will people say if it fails you can't really take decisions like that so a lot of these people they disagree with others sometimes but they still keep going on with their beliefs and they try to change the world by their actions not by waiting for other people to change the world everyone is sort of playing their role the most appropriate way to say this is that the world is a stage and everyone's kind of an actor everyone plays their role or fits into an unplayed role more than money which actually doesn't matter so much on the stage it is influence that matters influence over certain sectors of society over certain Fields over certain people the truth is every actor on the stage has an audience and combined the audiences everyone in the world all actors have their fans and haters once these actors s have influence they will make money and the thing I didn't realize is that most of the actors on stage know each other it's actually a small world on stage so the world economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland is like being backstage it's like peering behind the stage curtain and seeing what's really going on it's like walking on the street and being able to randomly walk into billionaires and celebrities and I was there and like a little spy with my meta aand glasses to show you what backstage really looks like cuz see as a content creator I'm really weird I can walk among the people backstage but I'm also more comfortable and I feel so much more at home with all of you all so like Deadpool this video is me breaking the fourth wall and showing you what actually happens and my learnings at the world economic Forum I'm breaking this video into five major learnings so here Music goes so I was invited by the YouTube team and I landed in Zurich and I was taken by a car to Davos now Davos has really tied security because of protesters when protesters realize that the world's most influential people are gathered together they try to protest and get their causes out there I think this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it sometimes the world's most influential are blind to certain topics and protests are a good way to get in front of them but they can also be severely disruptive if the things being protested are trivial anyway I had to wait one extra hour in the capab thanks to some protests going on also I forgot to mention it was really cold there was minus something and it was snowing I know this is not a related topic but I really like that weather but of course parts of my hands and face kept freezing so I was staying at the Google Alpine in like I told you YouTube had invited me and every major company and nation in the world has their own house that's right daos is full of houses Salesforce has their own house so does Intel and Qualcomm and India and even Africa during the day you can enter any house the houses also many of times have lodging so the house delegates don't have to find some other place to stay all the houses are designed very differently representing their brand colors and Vibe my favorite house was actually by palent there was these really cool LED strips which I'm definitely going to rip off that style I'm going to put some of those in our office then we went to get our badges I got a media badge which has decent levels of access across Davos you need to swipe your badge to get in in any place there are checkpoints all over now I spoke on a bunch of panels about AI plus content which we're pretty good at at this point at some of the houses that invited me but I didn't record any of it because the audience of the panels would see the white lights on the metari band so I really record uh we do over 400 million views a month across all our channels now many of them you don't even know about and over time we'll start learning which are the channels that we run and you'll come across them right but mainly my biggest learning at Davos especially with this is that this is some kind of big Fest where every faction or team has a house countries and big companies are kind of seen the same way and each house has Representatives it's like Harry Potter houses kind of right the second second learning is that a lot of big deals actually got done in Davos a Big Brand Clos and advertising deal with me there and the numbers are generally bigger I think everyone goes to daos in this Vibe of oh I'm here to close big deals or something like that right because you know other people are doing it you kind of get into a mood of also doing it I don't know it was kind of strange like India the country yes closed a lot of deals but they could have also closed those deals in India but believe it or not it's actually kind of convenient in Davos because the media is right outside the door you can walk to influential media people and say hey hey me and this person are closing this deal please go report on it and they report on it in India if you're sitting here you have to go through traditional channels people are busy you have to really think about the news cycle but there the media representatives are right outside I mean like I told you it's backstage people already know they're going to close a deal it's not like the deal happened there it's not like the decision- making happened there the closing the signing happened there no decisions are really made in Davos that is pred decided but the final sign is sometimes done there and reported there okay my third learning is that the parties suck at least the ones I went to when there's so much media nobody does anything I saw Mark Benny off the founder of Salesforce and he was just sitting in a place called Go's house with a bunch of people because see they also can't do stupid stuff because if you do stupid stuff the media will report on it nobody really does anything or maybe I just didn't find any insane stuff going on because I wasn't invited to any of those parties but I found it very boring just sitting and eating I mean especially the parts after the sessions right the nights and because you don't know the others it's basically like you're talking about basic stuff like what's the weather in your home place or something boring like that before we move on to the next part I want to share something that could help if you're hunting for a job as a fresher the demand for video editors is real and finding a good one is hard we have been fortunate in this case as we hire directly from A's video editing cohort almost all of the editors on my content team are from their cohort so if you are looking to break into video editing and work with creators like me check out their free editing master class and get a glimpse of their month intensive editing cohort that can help you land a job their recruitment network is 750 plus company strong so your odds of getting hired are high if you work hard the link is in the description now back to the video my next learning from Davos was about messaging four to 5 years ago and most of you don't know this I had this channel called Varun Maya level 2 i' made lots of very educational content on it we deep died into things like Unreal Engine right we did tutorials on it we did oops in Unreal Engine for example but notice how in the Unreal Engine series the first video has several thousand views but towards the end it has like 8090 views that's because everyone says they like super technical stuff but they don't the masses really get bored of it in the last year or so I stopped going too deep if you've noticed my content especially from a teaching front I've invested in companies that do it instead but me personally no the reason for this and what I learned at Davos again is that when you're on a stage and you have a large audience not everyone can understand everything when you're young you want validation from your PE so you get very technical about things but in places like Davos people speak more about broad goals like that event place I told you about the gos house in Go's house there are these banners that talk about un goals they are banners talking about broad goals right like no poverty zero hunger clean water sustainable cities these are very broad they aren't technical deep Dives right like in the zero hunger goal nobody's talking about hey use this very specific fertilizer to make crop growth better no they're talking about broad goals this is because people take back and remember only broad goals not the names of fertilizers the minute you get into specific fertilizers you get the equivalent of 80 to 90 views on my Unreal Engine content right low mental retention it's the same with my short form content I have so little time so we are being a little bit generic there it's what the mes want and if you don't get it that's actually you not understanding the world well and gos house is a good representation of it right go for the broader stuff don't get too deep dive unless you're making like a really long form video sometimes I get called out and cancel it for it saying oh you're not being technical anymore or whatever but that's okay it's the gos house phenomena it's important for you to learn also when you are communicating it's important to communicate the broad goals you want to achieve rather than specific advances unless someone is asking for specific advancements like if I was investing in your company I'd ask for specific things right how does this exactly work show me but otherwise for most busy people you're a turn off especially for the first conversation you get 80 to 90 Music views my last learning about Davos is about people I learned that the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the smartest they're not even the most hardworking they're actually just very good at taking risk and building relationships it's more courage than skill Jeff Bezos has that thing right there isn't a shortage of supply of Genius but there's definitely a shortage of supply of Courage so first before we get into courage let's talk about their distribution all the people in Davos have offline distribution in their phones they know maybe 50000 people who can help them with anything they want they know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy most of you have 10 to 20 people in your life who can help you with things your friends in the last year what I saw happen to to me was my own Rolodex the contact called a Rolodex has gotten very large this is Now offline distribution I have some online distribution but also I've built up offline distribution some of the people at Davos can just call Prime Ministers and presidents of countries they very very well networked and have built strong relationships most of you what I've noticed at least on the internet fail at relationships young people are more likely to dunk on someone they don't know on social media for the attention of other young people in faceless accounts but the minute you say go out and meet people they don't do that because that requires work that requires energy that requires you having to maintain a conversation with your real face and your real voice in Davos I saw a lot of meetings happen that were just relationship building No Agenda just I want to get to know this person and maybe there's an opportunity 5 years later They're all playing the long game I'll give you an example one of my subsidiary companies AOS Labs so AOS is the company I run but there's a subsidiary we have called Labs that's done an AI project with Honeywell we've actually done something with the Bangalore City police with Honeywell so we're interfacing with Honeywell SAS platform with a voice too AI solution to to help automate some of these calls that the police gets anyway so what I did is I went there and met the CEO of Honeywell IIA where we spoke for a bit about the project just building a relationship right now the project's already in the PO stage so it's like Canal's involvement is going to end now but over the next let's say 2 years or 3 years I'm sure we'll do something else with them so that relationship matters the other part is about risks you can take risks when you have a lot of information and a lot of Davos is about information I know what new AI models and AI tools around the corner I know which ones are doing well and which ones are about to close large funding rounds I know which ones are doing badly because I hear it in the offline world right the companies investors I'll speak to it's it's just access to know what is working and what's not really working so I know the companies where they've closed the last funding ground but will be announced 6 months later it's so valuable to have this information before anybody else because we build on top of models right so it's so important to know what's working what can we catch 6 months later 8 months later as the underlying model gets better what we did with Avatar in some senses right so I keep sharing all of this on my YouTube so definitely do subscribe this is the same as when I entered Google deep Min getting access to information which is not out on the internet lowers your risk profile when trying new things so the parent company AOS literally our only job is to build distribution and keep trying experiments right and then we pass it on to a subsidiary as it gets big enough so all of this is very useful for us because it lowers my risk profile of trying new things well that's it I like Davos from the world economic Forum it's not some Illuminati something something going on where some crazy parties and you know people controlling everything it's not really that I thought it was fun I learned a lot seeing behind the curtain seeing backstage I think was really cool and I'll keep sharing more of these insights with you anyway until next time bye,

For almost a decade, holograms have been a marketing gimmick. But what this Tokyo based startup Polalgraph has built feels like a portal to another world. Let me explain. So the core idea behind what Portal has done is that if you can track a person's head in 3D space, you can also track their eyes and render the scene from each point of view. Merge these two POVs together and the screen becomes a window almost like a portal. One you can peer around, lean into or walk past. You just put on a pair of lightweight LCD shutter glasses, while a Vive tracker or a webcam tracks your head. Then a 3D projector or monitor shows you two slightly different images, one for each eye, sync to your exact head position. The result, realtime motion parallax and depth. Lean left and you see behind the virtual object. Crouch and you're looking under it. Recently, they also showed off their flagship demo called Geoportal. It almost looks like a sand table, but what's projected onto it is a full-blown 3D miniature city. Now, with the speed technologies moving, I don't think we're far away from actually stepping inside virtual cities or maybe even playing Age of Empires on the table against our"}

The flagship has been around for so long. We wouldn't be able to exist without Photoshop. We do so much creative work today. What's the secret behind the longevity? You build products for yourselves. And you know, I think if you have a creative community and a DNA within the company, I think in many ways, you know, the most the sternest critics are yourselves. How does one get into the position of being CEO of Adobe? I was the last man standing. What is the career path to be where you're at? You know, what has that journey been like for you personally? If I go back really a long way around, I wanted to be a journalist growing up. I did not want to be CEO. I just wanted to build great products. I saw that you had recently said that in India, creativity might be the next IT boom. I want to know more about your thesis on on the creativity versus IT piece. We have the saying at Adobe where everybody has a story to tell. How do you not piss off like an entire legion of artists by going overly generative, but also how do you continue to stay relevant? Because if you don't do that, somebody else will counter position and say, \"Well, we're the generative only suite.\" If you use the Firefly models, we said we're the company that has to respect and champion the intellectual property rights of the creative professionals. When when did you know you were going to be CEO? Like what was that moment like? Well, you know, I ladies and gentlemen, I am with the Adobe Global Chair and CEO, Shantanu Narayan. Shantu, it's an absolute honor to do this. It's uh kind of been, you know, I've been using Adobe tools since since before I knew what I was doing in life, right? One of the first exposures to an Adobe tool I had was maybe CS5 or CS6. And at that time, you know, if you wanted to make a website, you'd have to use the slicing tool. You'd have to have an image. You have to slice it up. And since then, you know, the standards have changed. Since then, the ways you make a website have changed. The ways you do design have changed. Tools have come. tools have gone. I would have bet a lot because I was very bullish on, you know, on on the internet when I was very young. I would I was very bullish on the idea that at some point there will be somebody that comes and does what Adobe does in the cloud and does that better. But somehow Photoshop, right, the flagship has been around for so long. And before I get into anything, I just want to know the secret of this longevity, right? We wouldn't be able to exist without Photoshop. We do so much creative work today. What's the secret behind the longevity? Well, first Vun, it's a pleasure to be on your show and thank you for being a creative. Uh, it's always fun to hear stories about people whose lives have changed as a result of pursuing creative endeavors, something that, as you can imagine, we have a tremendous passion for. I think as it relates to, you know, building products, uh, you know, I think there are a couple of lessons I've learned. The first is you build products for yourselves. And you know I think if you have a creative community and a DNA within the company I think in many ways uh you know the most the sternest critics are yourselves and so we're I think always trying to say you know uh how do we build products that you know delight us and uh become more affordable accessible uh uh but you're being kind also I mean you know I think as all good companies we're probably more self-critical of the things that we haven't done right. Uh we've certainly done some things right and um you know it's just it's a constant endeavor. And do you feel like working on desktop apps because I've heard from a lot of people right working on desktops apps especially in this era it's pretty difficult because you're working with something that's legacy that's been built a long time ago. You're probably rebuilding parts of it as you go. Is it harder to do than let's say building something in the cloud if you're doing it from scratch? Well, we don't think of it as desktop apps and cloud or mobile. I mean I think we think of it a lot more as surfaces and you know when uh all of these tectonic technology shifts happen you know I when the move uh to a mobile device happened you know one of the assertions we made was mobile devices shouldn't just be consumption devices they should be creation devices when we saw the cloud we looked at it and said why should you be tethered to a computer inspiration strikes at many uh times and so you should do it So I you know I I think we uh are constantly thinking about what surface provides what value and are you taking advantage of the surface. Uh many times I think you unfortunately try to uh retrofit what works well in one surface and another surface and you fail and so you know I I I think we tend to think of it as the web affords frictionfree usage of technology. mobile allows you, you know, a different kind of a screen factor and and ease of use and and speed at doing things. Uh, but the desktop, I think, has continued and the PC, frankly, has continued to be the place where most people would say they're the most productive and they're the most efficient. And so, take advantage of all the surfaces because at the end of the day, that allows us to target and deal with more customers. No, that makes sense. Um, Chanta, I want to know how does one get into the position of being CEO of Adobe? Like what is it? What I was the last man standing? What is the career path to be where you're at? And you know, what has that journey been like for you personally? You know, I if I go back really a long way, Vun, I wanted to be a journalist growing up. Um you know I I was always fascinated by writing and um the first ever job which as you know uh at least in the 80s when I grew up in India um you didn't really have summer jobs and you didn't have internships but um I apprenticed at you know a newspaper doing copywriting. So you know journalism was always important to me. Um and now vicariously I'm still part of the publishing industry but um my professional journey I I've worked for all companies that I think have a creative DNA in them. I was at Apple for many years when Jurassic Park came out. I worked for Silicon Graphics. I started my own company. So like you I'm an entrepreneur. Uh unlike you, I was a failed entrepreneur at what I did. Uh a company I think everyone goes through enough like a bunch of failures before it works. uh a company called Pictra. I say the best thing that happened to me because that brought me to Adobe and Pictures on the web. U you know in the early '9s I felt like that social connection would be important. And then I came to Adobe because I looked at it and I said, \"Oh my god, look at the franchise that Adobe had.\" And Adobe was actually uh in conversations to potentially acquire picture. The deal didn't happen. And I said, you know, when I think about the brand of Photoshop and the brand of Illustrator and Acrobat, it was something that really resonated with me and um I was lucky enough uh to be recruited there. You know, my journey at Adobe changed dramatically over the years. Uh but the core genesis I think was that I'm you know maybe at my core I care about design. I care about creativity. I care about expression and you know Adobe is the ultimate privilege to be able to work for it. I did not want to be CEO when I came. It wasn't you know there are some people who are early enough in their life they know I want to be this particular role. I just wanted to build great products. You know what was your role like entering the company? I was called a VPG GM uh you know of uh one of the groups. I mean you mentioned that you're spending more time doing P&Ls. You know, everybody tends to think that being a GM, you know, you've sort of arrived. Uh, but funnily, I joined as a GM. The company hit a wall uh 6 months later and we laid off uh something like 25% of the company. This was in 1998 and u they then asked me to actually take over inesign. Inesign was this naent project. They said, \"Hey, you're a technologist.\" They completely reorganized to be functional. So I was no longer a general manager. I was an engineering uh lead for the layout products. Um and then 6 months later I think you know we shipped in design in design luckily one and then they asked me to run all engineering. So you know the path uh and career paths and I think even for your listeners they take different routes but I think uh if you can always think about where you add value and the value that needed to be added at that point was getting in design out of the door and you know we're at our core a product company and so and being able to run all products was a privilege. When when did you know you were going to be CEO? Like what was that moment like? Well, you know, I as I said, I joined in 98. By 99, I was running all engineering. By 2001, I was promoted to run all products. And you know, at some point there along the way, you're like, \"Oh, oh my god, maybe, you know, I will have the opportunity to run the company.\" And in 2005, I got promoted to be president and chief operating officer. And that felt more real at that point. But then we acquired macro media and you know the integration took a little while. Um but you know when the two founders uh who unfortunately have both passed you know both brilliant brilliant brilliant people John Waro and Chuck Gashki when they told me that the board had decided that I would be the next CEO. I mean professionally without a doubt um it was the most you know honor that I've received in my career and something that I cherish to this day. That's a crazy story. You know, in our own company now, we do thousands of videos a month. We never thought we'd get to this scale, right? And generative has really been the backbone. Everything from avatars to just the micro advantages you get from using generative, right? It could be as simple as generative fill. Extend the frame, right? It's just so many small things that have really made our life easier. We do content for 10 of our own channels, 40 client channels. Um and you know it's almost like in India for content we've kind of become the port of first call but we never imagined such a large opportunity to be there here right and we can see now that there's no end to where the opportunity is right and I saw that you had recently said that in India creativity might be the next IT boom right I've started to believe it but it's very hard to get the average person to believe this right because they're like well it has been around for a very very long time and creativity well it still feels like India would be you know India's not there on the global stage yet but I think generative really fills that gap. Uh I want to know more about your thesis on on on the creativity versus IT piece. Well, you know it's I think it's true across so many dimensions, right? I mean the first thing is you know we have this saying at Adobe where everybody has a story to tell and so if you think about the fact that everybody has a story to tell and they want to tell their story at the end of the day that's in a way your addressable market for the world, right? Um if you think about education and why is it in this day and age that education is still about writing rather than you know animating or having videos or uh you know being able to express yourself graphically. Um when you think about any commerce business right now a commerce business is basically about an experience and the person who creates the best experience is going to be the one that wins. So you know if you decompose what creativity really means uh as a part of every industry right uh as well as this fundamental social need I mean why have the social networks really exploded it's because people fundamentally have a need to interact in a way that's unique and personal to them. So that's why I'm a big believer that at the end of the day, creativity is uh you know one of those fundamental uh social desires that are going that are going to create massive markets. Now how you decide what component of each of these other businesses is as a result of creativity versus is commerce really creativity? I tend to think it is right and it plays a role. uh but that so I think it's the lens by which we approach it allows us as a company to then think about oh my god if we have this big opportunity are we capitalizing on the opportunity I think in many ways when companies scale it's not that they suddenly wake up one morning and you know the market has grown it's you're changing the aperture by which you look at the opportunity I mean when you were talking about it you know whether it's the channel that you run versus a channel for a company versus a channel. So I I think that's how we're trying to expand you know how we think about creativity. And you know when I went to Waves and you you gave a keynote at Waves as well, right? Like if you the minute you landed in Mumbai to the point where you were at the event, it was plastered with like billboards on Waves and audio video communication. It if if I was Adobe I would be like dancing, right? I would be like great like everyone's woken up. I was so surprised to see a the spends b the kind of you know time energy and attention that the government is now giving you know things like creativity I think they're very bullish that this could be the next you know sort of it-esque industry u do you have a sense of how many more jobs could be created here maybe not tangible numbers but just you know what how you see this volume expand is it a training thing is it a you know if you were to architect this how would you do it well I think first it it starts with education and it starts with accessibility I you know the story that's often told about how somebody left a computer you know unattended in a small village in India and how you know people just embrace it. So I I think the first thing is accessible and I think with mobile devices and PCs it's just going to become more accessible which I think is great uh because when you have accessibility you know I I think you foster opportunity u I think the second thing is uh you know inspiration. So if you have accessibility, you want to be inspired, right? And I think if there are two things that inspire people in this country, at least maybe there's a little bit of a, you know, cliche, but it's sports and cricket and it's films, right? And both of them are, you know, are inherently also experiences that you do. And so I don't know that I have a number. I know it's big. I mean, we have aspirations to even in the education market, you know, find two crores of people. And how do you it used to be reading, writing, and arithmetic when I grew up were the three skills that people said were the way to improve your lot. Why isn't it reading, writing, arithmetic, and digital literacy with creativity a fundamental part of that? So if you think about it that way, then every single student with this skill now has an opportunity if you're a small and be small business, if you're a person working in the creative. So I I think it's unlimited. Now how much of that then translates into economic you know GDP and the growth associated with that? I think that's work ahead of us. But I what I was really impressed with what the government was doing was to say hey this is just one of those fundamental things that if we do right you know we're going to foster a new generation. I know they've always been enamored with the animation industry and the graphics industry. The publishing industry still in India is probably the most lucrative publishing industry in the world. Right. And so I I but I think it solves these fundamental issues of education, of opportunity. And so I I think it's immense. Yeah. Um I have a question around generative AI and this is a I often say that somebody's asking me this the other day and I and I said that it's kind of a tough spot to be in Adobe's like shoes right now mainly because there's two clear audiences here, right? Or or maybe that's the general subset of two audiences. one who will adopt everything that everything new in generative AI they want it they want to speed up their workflows they probably have a lot of work on their plate and they want to move forward there's also a group of creatives that is a little bit anti-generative right and there is a line that they draw which is well generative fill is fine but if you're using you know um you know something which is completely AI generated that's a problem right so it is it's hard because you can't end up building two product suites right one with generative one without generative Um, so how do you see this? Like how do you not piss off like an entire legion of artists by going overly generative, but also how do you continue to stay relevant? Because if you don't do that, somebody else will counterposition and say, well, we're the generative only suite. I I actually think Adobe has done a phenomenal job of addressing that upfront. And part of what we talk about as a company is it's not just the technology, but it's the responsibility that we have as one of the larger companies in the space to speak on behalf of the community. So I I'll geek out for a little while. First, as it relates to our models and the models that we've created, as you know, we were the company that said we're only going to create these models based on licensed content. Very unique, very differentiated. And so if you use the Firefly models, we said we're the company that has to respect and champion the rights, the intellectual property rights of the creative professionals, which is why we do it. You know, we have Behance, as you know, it's one of the largest, if not the largest creative professional network in the world, but we did not train on that because we didn't have rights to do that. So, first we made a very strong uh, you know, statement of what we thought about intellectual property. Now, I think that appealed to the community because the community said if there's one company that's speaking up for the rights of and I think the courts will eventually have to appine on some of this stuff, but we make that stance and we actually have stuck by it. Um, I think there's so how do we think about it in terms of product strategy? To your point, we have such a wide variety of customers. consumers who want to use a product like Adobe Express, they probably don't need the flexibility of multiple models. So, they're just like, I fear the blank page. The real beauty or the benefit of generative AI is that most people when they have something that they want to create, they fear the blank page. Whereas being able to have a conversation and have that process kicked off either with a template or with a conversation enables them to, you know, uh, be more productive. So I think for that community, we've built in Firefly, we will have Express, but the fact that it's commercially safe. The consumer probably cares a little bit less about what's underlying the technology, they just want to get stuff done. The creative professional on the other hand, as you know, we started off with for generative fill or generative extend, we only had Firefly support because we were convinced that that was the right way to serve the creative community. With enterprises, you know, the largest enterprises in the world are partnering with us because they don't want their content ingested by people who don't respect intellectual property. So, we've created custom models for them. So now we also have this flexibility where if you're within Coke, you're creating a marketing campaign, you have a custom model of Firefly that has all your assets as well as Adobe's Firefly because that's also, you know, designed to be commercially safe. It's the Firefly model fine-tuned on their internal app. Exactly. Um and you do that as a service or is that Yeah, we do that as a service you know uh and the interest in that as you can imagine is immense because you know your intellectual property is your data. They don't want their data you know scraped on the internet and so that's why they do that. However, you also if you think about where creatives are using it right now, creatives have also embraced this idea of when I'm ideulating, maybe I'm okay using, you know, a model that's not designed to be commercially safe. But then later when I use it in production, I want to make sure that I use it because that's like going to an art gallery and getting inspired by a painting on the wall, you know, to to do some creative. And so at the recent Max conference we showed how you know we will support thirdparty models and that's actually come as a result of uh you know customers saying we love Adobe products support the third party model and we will differentiate between when we're using it for ideiation versus when we're using it to be uh used in production. As you know also and again I'm geeking out but in the Photoshop when you upload a picture and you say hallucinate with not just the text but in the spirit of this picture we actually ask you to testify that you have rights to that picture. So you know it's this balance that we're trying to do. We want to give flexibility. We want to serve the customers in the diverse ways in which they want to but we also want to make it clear what our northstar is of what we stand for which is you know how we stand for the intellectual property how we stand for content authenticity. We're thrilled. We have 4,000 people who've signed up to, you know, uh, be part of this content authenticity initiative where you, uh, will specify the provenence, but it's work in progress. And I think, you know, we're also a company that's smart enough to say this thing will evolve and if we don't evolve with the times, we won't be serving our customers and our prospective customers. Well, I have a a CEO question to you, right? Um so when I started a company when I started this company actually we started with creativity then we said you know we'll infuse technology in here to get scale which I think has worked out well but now I find I spend most of my time like I said you know pre this chat I spend most of my time on P&L managing people figuring out how to hire people I want to know from a time management perspective right how do you actually manage your time like what do you spend most of your time on what is top priority for you what are the messages on your on your phone that you need to like like how would you say your your time management and day management framework is? How much how much time do you spend on hiring? Like I want to know everything like and you can go you can geek out as much as you want. Well, the reality is you know what you focus on changes. You know I I I'll share with you what one of the co-founders John Waro told me when I took my job. when I first took my job, he said, \"If I don't like my job, I have one person to blame.\" And in many ways, that was the most profound piece of advice that he gave me. And so, bro, what I'll tell you is you have more power to spend the time on whatever you want to spend the time on. And you know one of the things we try and do as a senior executive team every year at the beginning of the year is we say what are the two or three things that you want to do that you think will really move the needle or have impact in the company and then disproportionately spend time on that uh your demands whether they be IR investors or you know PR or whether it's product or whether it's customers it could be infinite and you know time is your most valuable commodity. So I'm actually quite thoughtful about where I am going to spend my time and where I'm not going to spend my time. And the power of a team is that you can get somebody else to do the stuff that you're either not very good at or you don't have an inclination to do. So but it changes. One year I might say I want to spend time on industry partnerships and I'm going to invest my time and energy on that. But I have that conversation with my team so that somebody else is picking up the stuff that perhaps I'm not going to be spending time on and then you trust your team to you know do the other stuff. So I that that's the advice that I would give but it changes. The one constant I would say in my job is product. At the end of the day we're a product company. If you don't build innovative great products and in many ways my role is chief product officer as well right when you're running a tech company you should be that. And so that's the constant. But otherwise I flip it around. I flip it around because I want to have fun doing the things that I want to do and and I you know dirty secret for both of us. We have the luxury of doing that. Can I ask you a question on how you communicate with your team? Do you are you very verbal about it? Do you do you do meetings or are you like I'm going to write a note and do you spend a lot of time writing those notes? Like what's your feed like how do you how do you communicate with them? You know, my philosophy on the team, we have pretty regular check-ins every Monday. So, a Monday is sort of And how big is that exactly? Six, seven people. I mean, that's the thing when people also say, \"Oh my god, you run this large company.\" The liberating fact is you still have the same number of people whether the company is, you know, 5 million or the company is 5,000 or the company is 50. And, you know, it's the power of that team that helps you manage and scale and grow the company. I like email because I think it forces me to be more precise and I also find that you know when when you have a conversation with people people interpret different things and so I I I've always liked the discipline of writing it but only for important things right I mean if you have a product strategy issue or if you have something that you think the company is not doing well then I think taking the trouble to actually write it pays off in spades but otherwise you know we have meetings it's a very open flow we call it roundt and the roundt idea is whatever's top of mind I mean in many ways I also m view my role as removing obstacles and so I have my agenda of the things I'm probably interested in but I have to spend as much time on the things that people are interested in either getting my opinion either make helping them make a decision or you know just having that cross in many ways it's the cross team conversations that you have to spend time on in your role because you're they don't communicate as as well. No or they do it in silos. No, it's not the silos. It's more like that's your role. I mean, what's your role? You are consolidating across the different functions. So, I it's it's not about them. It's about you, right? And if you're playing that role of assimilating between product and marketing or legal and finance, uh I I just view that as that's my role. And so I think one of the best parts about me creating content and I tell this to people is that I just get access to people like you and it just helps me become a better entrepreneur because I'm just like I have this I have these questions and now I have the best in the world to kind of ask them and you know figure it out. What does the Adobe India team do? Like the team here that I see right there about 3,000 people in this campus. what is Adobe India's focus you know um when we first started the campus and this was you know probably six months before I joined the company um Nares Gupta who started the company had this vision of he wanted to just create the best hire the best and build innovative products and not do stuff that would be perceived as you know maintenance or grant work and that stayed true to I mean part of what strategy is if you can't articulate the strategy in a few words it's probably too complicated so we've always believed in Adobe India I mean apart from the sales because you know India is a big market but if your question was around what does the product team do it's all about product innovation and therefore they're involved in every major product in fact we run an entire business Abigan Modi who runs the India office right now he runs the global business for acrobat and PDF F and so you know I time is not really and time and location is not how you run stuff and so uh but we do fundamental stuff from you know I think we file the number of patents that are filed from this place has always been off the charts but it started with this germ of an idea of you know hire absolutely the best and create a differentiated product group that believes that their job is building innovative products and ownership and you know when people feel ownership then you're not holding them accountable. They're holding themselves accountable. And I it's it's thrived because of that core sort of way in which the company was formed. I have one last question for you. I think you've been generous with your time. I have one last question. My wife actually runs a video editing school and she said one of the biggest requests they had was, you know, a youngster who is for the first time getting into some of the Adobe tools, especially in India. There's been this request of there needs to be a lowcost easy way for them to get in and you know they will be the biggest champions and influencers of Adobe inside the augs once they get placed because the school also has a lot of placements. Do you have a plan for to do to ever do a lower cost easier way to get in sort of product for you know premier pro at least? Well there are two ways I would you know interpret the question. The first is we want to make sure these products are easily the on-ramp to the products. We want them to be as simple as possible. And so I I think again the fact that we have the spectrum from mobile apps to web-based apps to uh desktop apps, we have actually made them way more uh you know accessible. The second thing is uh educational pricing and you know finding ways to have educational pricing. Not enough people know about that actually and we should market that better and we should market that better and uh but you know clearly I I think this is an area that we need to do more. I think we've done a lot of great stuff but making it affordable and accessible because you're absolutely right. I mean the folks that your wife is you know training are going to be the next generation creatives and the more they are and the more they love Adobe software when they enter the professional world. I mean the irony is that also happened in many ways when you know piracy was rampant in many countries but when we moved to the cloud we were incredibly surprised by how people were fundamentally wanting to do the right thing you know for the value that we're getting and it got cheaper and so that's a constant refrain I think the mobile apps will be you know we have premium mo mobile apps so you know you can do a lot of that functionality but we will also follow up with your wife's uh video editing uh school to understand how we can serve them better. Awesome. Thank you so much, Shantu. This was amazing. I learned so much. I hopefully become a better, you know, founder after this. And this is so enlightening. Thank you so much. It's my pleasure. Thanks for having me. Likewise."}

First up, see how they handle navigation. So, I'm wearing the new glasses, which has a screen. You can't see it, but I'm actually navigating Google Maps as we speak. This is what I see. By the way, I see this. So, I can actually navigate. I just have to look down. And when I'm looking down, you can see that I'm actually navigating. I'm just going to turn. Next up is their realtime translation. This is something which blew my [Music] mind. As you can see, the translation happens instantly. The glasses can understand multiple languages and show you what's being said right in your field of view. This could completely change how we communicate across language barriers. Now, what makes these special is that they combine cameras, microphones, speakers, and a hidden display that only you can see. Google built these with Samsung and Qualcomm, creating a new Android XR platform that's designed to work perfectly with your phone. Plus, with Gemini AI built-in, the glasses can see what you're looking at and provide helpful information right when you need it. They understand your location and which way you're facing, so directions appear exactly when and where you need them. The best part, Google's partnering with Wobbby Parker and Gentle Monster, so these will actually look stylish. No more clunky tech."}

Let's do a quick wrap. And I'm about to break down everything mind-blowing from the 2025 keynote in just a quick minute. Now, Google is going allin on AI that is more intelligent, agentic, and personalized than ever before. First, they're improving their most intelligent models. Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro are getting major upgrades. The standout is Deep Think, a new enhanced reasoning mode in Gemini 2.5 Pro that can tackle super complex math and coding tasks through parallel thinking. Next up, Gemini powered agents are next level this year. Project Mariner can now juggle up to 10 tasks at once, learns workflows after you teach it just once, and powers the new agent mode inside the Gemini app. Think finding apartments, booking tours, or handling forms automatically. Plus, what's really cool is you'll soon be able to shop with AI, including virtually trying on clothes from your own photos with just a single upload. They're also launching impressive generative media models. Imagine 4 creates stunning images with better text rendering. While V3 is the first video model with native audio generation, adding environmental sounds and even dialogue to videos. Now, Google is also introducing Flow, a new AI filmmaking tool designed specifically for their advanced models that helps storytellers create cinematic clips and scenes without complicated production. For developers, Jules is now available in public beta. It's an asynchronous coding agent that integrates directly with repositories and handles tasks on your behalf. Then we have Android XR which is bringing Gemini to glasses and headsets. These smart glasses come with cameras, microphones, and an optional inland lens display working with your phone to give you hands-free AI assistance. Google is partnering with Wobbby Parker and Gentle Monster to make stylish versions. Finally, let's not forget Beam, previously called Project Starline. This AI first 3D video communication platform creates remarkably lielike conversations with speech translation capabilities. You see, I was at Google IO again this time and got my hands on some of these tools and demos. Trust me, this isn't just incremental progress."}

[Music] They left behind a a ball today. It bounced higher than I can jump. What manner of magic is that? According to Google's announcement, across the board, V3 excels from text and image prompting to real world physics and accurate lip-s syncing. It understands your ideas well. You can tell a short story in your prompt and the model gives you back a clip that brings it to life. This understanding is what makes VO3 such a gamechanger for filmmakers. But speaking of filmmakers, Google also designed Flow as an AI filmmaking tool explicitly built for VO. Flow takes Vio's capabilities further, helping storytellers explore their ideas without bounds, and create cinematic clips and scenes for their stories. With Flow, you describe shots in natural language. Manage story elements in one place and weave everything into beautiful scenes. Flow also unlocks powerful features like camera controls that help you define precise camera movements, including rotations, dollies, and zooms. There's also outpainting that expands your frame turning your video from portrait to landscape and object add and remove which lets you modify scenes while maintaining natural interactions. All this tech is available now for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the US and more countries will follow soon. The future of filmm just took a massive leap forward and I can't wait to see what you guys create with all of these AI tools."}
{"video_id": "tzqnycMoldI", "title": "Why Freshers Are Struggling to Get Tech Jobs", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzqnycMoldI", "transcript": "Have you noticed it's gotten way harder to land a tech job as a fresher? According to data from DD, the biggest tech companies, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Nvidia, and Palanteer have had zero net growth in hiring over the last 3 years. That's right, zero growth. The total headcount today is basically the same as it was 3 years ago. So, what exactly is happening during the pandemic? These companies went on a massive hiring spree. Just look at this graph. That huge spike in 2022, that's when they collectively added over 120,000 employees in a single year. But then in 2023, we actually saw negative growth with companies cutting jobs. But the big question is, how are these tech giants growing their businesses without growing their teams? It boils down to these four fundamental changes. First, they overhired during the zero interest rate pandemic years between 2020 and 2022, assuming the demand boom would continue long-term. It did not. Second, with higher interest rates now, CFOs are under intense pressure to improve operating margins, and keeping headcount flat is the most direct way to boost those numbers. Third, these companies are investing billions in generative AI infrastructure. The cost of capital for these chips and systems is enormous, leaving less budget for new hires. Fourth, there's emerging evidence that AI productivity tools might already be enabling these companies to accomplish more with their existing workforce. This last point is actually huge because it's changing a fundamental relationship in business. The data historically showed that if a company's revenue grew by 10%, its headcount would also grow by about 10%. But these AI productivity gains are breaking that pattern. Now these tech leaders are testing whether they can grow revenue without growing headcount at all. This represents the potential end of the hyperrowth hiring era that defined tech from 2010 to 2021."}

For example, I want to become Venom. Now, I want tentacles all over my face. Now, we're going to have somebody from the comment section punch me. Now I'm going to disintegrate. All of these effects were created with AI using a tool called Higs Field. Here's how it works. Now, all you have to do is upload a first frame from your video and go to the effects panel. That's it. Choose your desired effect, such as Venom taking over your body, getting punched, or turning into metal. The software uses AI to analyze your image and apply realistic transformations that follow your movements throughout the clip. What's mind-blowing is that until recently, these effects would have taken professional VFX artists hours or even days to create. They'd have to manually track every movement and adjust the effect frame by frame. But now, this tech does it automatically in minutes. The coolest part is that this tech is accessible to everyone. No fancy equipment or Hollywood budget is needed. People are using it for everything from social media videos to indie films. A teenager in their bedroom can now create effects that rival major studios."}

I find your enthusiasm unsettling Peter Griffin and gooning gang. Explain this adolescent term. Now, we can't tell you what it means for obvious reasons, but it shows Peter Griffin holding a lightsaber and facing off with Darth Vader. But instead of Vader saying something serious like he usually does, he says something totally unexpected. So, how did this happen? Well, it's because Epic Games added characters like Darth Vader using AI so players could interact with them. According to Fortnite's website, when players talk to Darth Vader, their voice gets converted into text and fed into Google's Gemini, which writes a reply matching Darth Vader's personality. Then 11 Labs, a texttovoice model, takes that reply and speaks it out loud in Vader's voice. Now, that's what should have happened ideally, but players quickly realized that by asking Vader to repeat after me or using clever replies, they could bypass Fortnite's filters and trick Gemini into saying almost anything they want. In other words, they weren't exactly hacking the system, but manipulating Gemini by finding loopholes in how LLM understand language. While this might be funny to some, remember that Fortnite is played by millions of kids as well, and pre-exposing them to such stuff probably isn't good for them. Epic Games says they've now fixed the issue with a hot fix and added more safety checks. Like, if a player is under 13, they cannot talk to these AI characters without parental consent. But it'll be interesting to see what happens"}

It's called the Gak Pickup 01. And while it definitely borrows that stainless steel angular look, it packs some features Tesla doesn't have. Let me show you why this truck is so cool. First up, there's the smart suspension system. This truck has sensors that scan the road a thousand times every second. When it detects bumps or dips, it automatically adjusts each wheel independently to keep the body perfectly level. Then there is design, which is clearly inspired by Tesla with that distinctive stainless steel body that won't rust and doesn't need paint. Of course, Gak added its own style with sleek LED light strips across the front and back and chunky off-road tires that look ready for any adventure. Now, inside the car, it gets really interesting. The steering wheel can actually slide from the left side to the right side of the dashboard. This means they can sell the exact same truck in America, Australia, Japan, anywhere without making different versions for different markets. That's some clever engineering. However, Gak outshines Tesla in its adaptability. While Tesla locked their Cybert truck into one fixed layout, Gak completely rethought what a truck cabin could be. They created a modular system where you can slide different setups in and out depending on what you need that day. When it comes to raw power, GAK claims 12,000 new m of torque at the wheels. That's the force that gets you moving and pulling heavy loads. Tesla's Cybert truck edges ahead with 14,000 new m. But both trucks have more than enough power for most people's needs. Of course, there's a catch. While people are already driving Cybert trucks on American roads, the Gak Pickup01 is still just a concept that won't hit production until around 2027. Pricing hasn't been announced yet, but if Gak can land anywhere near the rumored sub $40,000 mark, it could make this thing a serious competitor to Tesla."}

The CEO posted it on Hacker News saying they wanted to open up access of generative AI to all developers for free. But check out what one user commented. What's the difference with Copilot? In my exact 3minut test, it did worse, even if only slightly. Right now, it is free, but that won't last, right? Do I have to expect any shady data collection practices? More interestingly, how is this trained? Have you guys done your own fine-tuning of GPT3 or is it something completely different? Fast forward to today and that same tool someone brushed off is now potentially worth $3 billion. This completely challenges the common advice that you shouldn't just build rappers around AI APIs. And companies like Windsurf prove there's massive value in making AI more accessible to developers. Now, you know, the AI world moves at lightning speed. A product casually dismissed after a three-minute test is now just 3 years later at the center of what could be one of the biggest AI acquisitions ever. A lesson from this is that maybe we should all not judge the first version of a product too quickly."}

This is the first video edited with the Neuralink. This is my old voice narrating this video cloned by AI from recordings before I lost my voice. This is Brad, an ALS patient who can't move or speak, but can somehow control his MacBook using just his thoughts thanks to Neuralink. It all starts with a tiny coinsized chip placed inside Brad's motor cortex, the part of the brain responsible for movement. Now, from this chip, about 1,024 ultra thin electrodes are inserted directly into the soft jelly-like brain matter, carefully listening to individual neurons. Now, every time Brad thinks about something, like moving his tongue or clenching his jaw, specific neurons activate. The electrodes then pick up this neural activity and send it to the chip where an AI decodes these signals and turns Brad's thoughts into precise cursor movements and clicks. What's mind-blowing is how this entire process happens every 15 milliseconds, which is as real time as it gets. But Brad didn't use it to just click around. He edited an entire video, dragging files, navigating menus, trimming clips, picking transitions, and even fine-tuning the timeline using nothing but his thoughts and an AI clone of his voice. What's even more impressive is that unlike eyetracking systems that don't work in bright light, Neuralink works anywhere. It doesn't care if you're indoors, outdoors, sitting, lying down. It just listens to your brain. That's it. And this is just the beginning. Imagine a future where two people could talk without even saying a word. where you could just think about something and the decoded signals could be sent directly to another person's implant and stimulate the right neurons, transmitting ideas directly with near zero information loss. It's both exciting and scary to think about how human communication will evolve in the coming decades."}

Now, researchers at the University of Zurich secretly slipped AI bots into social media conversations, and no one even realized they weren't talking to real people. Here's how it went down. The researchers set up 13 AI powered accounts on Reddit's Change My View subreddit, a community specifically designed for people to share their opinions and invite others to challenge or change their perspective. But here's the shocking part, how these bots actually worked. They analyzed the person's entire Reddit posting history to figure out their age, gender, location, political beliefs, and even their likes and dislikes based on their profile. Sometimes the AI even crafted elaborate fake personas. One AI accused members of a religious group of causing the deaths of hundreds of innocent traders, farmers, and villagers. Another posed as a trauma counselor specializing in abuse. One AI even claimed to be a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter. The Reddit moderators discovered this experiment after the fact and were furious. They filed an ethics complaint with the university, arguing that people come to their forum to engage with other humans, not to be unwitting subjects in an AI experiment. This connects to what some refer to as the dead internet theory. The notion that increasingly our online interactions may be with AI bots rather than real humans. As these bots become more sophisticated and widespread, how will we know who or what we're really talking to? I find this both fascinating and deeply unsettling. Technology is amazing, but we need transparency about who's behind the screen. Could you tell if you were debating with an AI all along?"}

And you can change nearly everything. Its color, lights, interior, bumpers, screens, and even converted into an SUV. What's even more impressive is that it's cheaper than a Tesla at just $20,000. And that's no coincidence. If you look closely at the name, you'll notice that the name Slate is actually an anagram of Tesla, meaning it has the exact same letters, just rearranged. And that's exactly what Slate is doing. It's taking what Tesla built, futuristic, cool, and expensive cars, and rearranging it into something more minimal, simpler, and affordable. Now, a lot of people on X have even been suggesting that it might actually be a subbrand of Tesla to attract a more affordable customer base. But in reality, it's backed by Jeff Bezos, one of Elon's biggest rivals in the space race already. And that alone makes Slate even more intriguing. Is Slate trying to beat Tesla just like Blue Origin is trying to beat SpaceX? Maybe, maybe not. But what's clear is while the world is going crazy over futuristic looking EVs, Slate is taking a minimalistic approach by doing the opposite.

Spanning over 81,000 m, this dark factory operates completely autonomously with no lights, no shifts, and no humans. But how? Well, all thanks to Xiaomi's AI powered manufacturing system called Hyper Intelligent Manufacturing Platform or Hyper IMP. You see, most factories run on static automation. That means each machine is programmed only once and it performs only one specific task over and over again and that works fine until something goes wrong, a misalignment or a sensor glitch and suddenly the machines don't know how to handle it and need humans to fix it. But Xiaomi's factory is different. The machines aren't just following instructions. They're also training a central AI system called HyperMP by sending real-time data. The AI system then uses this data to constantly analyze every machine in the factory. And if something seems off, it goes ahead and fixes it without any human involvement. But this isn't about Xiaomi cranking out a new phone every second. It's about a much bigger shift happening in China. China has cracked the code on something far more powerful, automation at scale. People think of China as a country of cheap labor. But what they don't realize is that it's not because Chinese factories are filled with lowcost workers. It's because those factories have now become completely automated and are being run almost entirely by robots. And this is the kind of automation that changes how a country innovates. China isn't using robots just to make things quicker, but to free up human time so people can stop doing repetitive work and focus on R&D, innovation, and improving technology."}

It helps customers understand me better, improving satisfaction on both sides of the call. This mood allows me to stay authentic, making every interaction more personal and effective. Now, the AI operates through a virtual audio driver with just 200 milliseconds of latency. That's faster than the human perception of conversation. Plus, Crisp trained their AI on thousands of paired recordings of Indian English and American English speech patterns to make this possible. However, it preserves your unique voice characteristics while modifying the pronunciation and intonation patterns. It's essentially changing how you sound without altering your voice. Now, this tech is just weird, isn't it? It's like we're creating digital masks for our voices. Think about it. Your accent is part of your identity, your story, your culture, and now an AI can just strip that away in milliseconds. But what do you think about this?

This entire thing that we're about to do right now, it's going to be short in one take. There's no script. Uh we're doing it a day in advance because it's just easier. It avoids all the tragedies that can occur with power outages. But ladies and gentlemen, in the last two years, AOS has really grown. We're close to about 300 employees at this point. And it's just been a phenomenal ride. We have set a benchmark when it comes to video, not just across India, but globally. And a lot of people in India now recognize that. A lot of people globally recognize our standard, the standards we've set in video. But I wasn't satisfied. As we grew, I said, \"There's something I've been wanting to do since I was a kid, and it's very expensive to do. It is technically very difficult to pull off. It requires too many things to come together.\" And I said, \"If I don't, who will? Someone's got to try.\" So, I've hyped this project enough. Let's get straight into it. Ladies and gentlemen, today I want to introduce you to something that's taken 8 months, 40 people, really skilled people, and we've done it in utmost secrecy, and I hope you really like it. Ready? Here goes. I bet there are a lot of people leaving from the live stream right now. It's a watch. It tells the time. It's not smart. There's no AI. I mean, what more do you expect from creators or influencers or whatever? Right. This is the best that uh us as a class can do. Right. Right. I think we can do a lot better. In fact, this entire box here, it's misdirection. We don't actually need it. I practiced that for a bit. So ladies and gentlemen, without much further ado, I hope you're watching this in 4K because let the footage roll. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm so sorry. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Hey. [Music] Wow. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Hey, What you saw was really special because it's just a small fraction of what's already built. And there's something very special that happened. A very specific technological shift that just it's not even a shift. It's just something that got really good. And no, it has nothing to do with AI. There was negligible AI in what you saw right now. And I don't expect text to 3D to be really good this year. I don't even expect it to be good next year. So this was done in an old school way but in a very different manner with a very different pipeline. And I want to shed some light on it because it was so much monumental effort and like I told you what you saw was just a fraction of what we have already built. You see we set a benchmark in video content. Globally we're known for that. So we now want to set a benchmark in this new industry. And we are going to do it by setting our standards for quality so high that when you see it, you can't tell where it came from except for the where the story has come from and what the assets kind of look like, where the origin of the assets is. But I had somebody recently go out and put another very high-quality AAA game that just came out, some screenshots of it, compared to screenshots of some of our levels and some of the assets that we had generated and created without any of the set dressing because sometimes that can mislead people and without any of the extra environmental work and ask people to rate it. Most people rated us either on par or above the other competitor, which is crazy considering that this is of Indian origin and this hasn't been done so far. But I need to tell you the secret because it is a big one. 100% of the following screenshots that you're going to see on your screen right now were captured in engine. Take a look. So, what changed and why is this special? It's special because we now have one of the largest scan libraries for a game in the world. We have over a thousand assets. That's right. Over a thousand assets that's been scanned specifically for this game with the highest of quality cameras with technique that only a video company would really understand well. And it's very easy for us to adopt a photogometry technique, at least the way we're supposed to do it. At least the way we're supposed to do it to get super high quality assets. We've adopted it. And the way we did it was crazy. We blocked out an entire town. That's right. We went out and blocked an entire town, the town of Chanderei. And we had our team scan it. a very expensive affair. I wouldn't recommend to anybody watching. But not only did we send up video teams there, we not only scanned the buildings, we also used drones to scan, you know, floor 2, floor 3, uh, 15th century architecture. It really was the most grueling process for the team. And that was followed up that was followed up by the most monumental 3D cleanup effort that I think any team here has undertaken because just scanned assets are not good enough. You also need to be able to clean them. You also need to have an actual artist with 3D modeling, not just 3D modeling skill, but artistic sense to go in and say, \"Well, the window sill is not perfect. I need to fix that.\" Well, the handle of the auto is not perfect. I need to fix that. Well, the front of the um, you know, uh, scooter is not perfect. I need to replace that, you know, area. Somebody with that skill and we had to have a huge team of them actually sitting together cleaning up all of this. Really, if I knew everything I knew both about the expense and the amount of coordination this takes, I probably wouldn't have done this. But thankfully, we're done now. And we have the largest scan library, one of the largest scan libraries for a game ever. I want to show you some of the scans. This is something that will hopefully interest you. As you can see, this is not a photo. It's not a picture. This is actually a 3D asset. And as you can see, even with things like the fruits, we had to actually go scan them. We have to make sure things that can't easily be scanned like tires and spokes. We had to remodel. So it's not this magical technique where you press a button everything gets done. But there's just lot of human effort that went into this. And we didn't stop just at environmental assets. We went and also got the most authentic clothing from India and worked really hard on scanning them and getting them into engine which means we needed to build our own rig. And this is where a lot of people have this very myopic view of engineering, right? Either you're an engineer that just writes front end code or whatever. Like we think that's so myopic and I've said this for so many years because what we did was we sliced an office chair in half. We turned it around. We motorized it so it can turn. Then we put a wood plate on top of it. Then we put markers so that the scanning software can understand the scene better. Then we put a mannequin on top. Then we set up a perfect light box that only us as a video company. I mean other people could possibly do it but it is it's hard to get that perfect photogometry lighting. You need perfectly even lighting uh so that there's no baked shadows that you can kind of see in the scene or bake lights that you can see in the scene. We had to set up you know an arm. We had to put the camera with uh you know flash and then a polariz on top of it so that it's not able to you know pick up too much of the reflective surfaces. We had to put all this together and automate the entire process as we moved the arm and automatically hit the flash as the cam as the um wheel kept turning. It was I mean I don't even know how to describe it. It's just it's such a it's such a good example of Indian jugad. The ability to do things even when we might not have the means or the resources. Very hard to get a rig in India. And honestly, it's not that we couldn't afford the rig. is that it's just impossible to get it down in India and we'd have, you know, hell to face with customs. So, we just decided, let's just make it ourselves. Now, the scans alone aren't enough. You actually have to create the other maps for this object. So, you need to now create the roughness map. You need to make sure you figure out how shiny it is. You need to create the metallic map. Uh, if it's got metal parts, you wanted to actually make it seem like it's there in the real scene in game. Uh, so it's a lot of work, post-process work, even after you got the scans done. And for a lot of the smaller scans simply because we're scanning a huge volume of clothes, we just went with phones. As long as the lighting setup is good enough, it's not that the actual equipment is the blocker. It is the fact that you need to get the setup well and make the entire process happen. Then the entire process of rettopology, which means we need to create these scans and we need to make sure the mesh structure, which is absolute garbage that comes out from scans, works in a game. Which means when you're actually simulating these objects in game, you're simulating a doti in game, they actually feel and look real. And sometimes you have to bake them down into simpler structures, right? So a lot of work that went in making sure these are game ready and then composited on top. And then we also scanned human faces that actually exist in India, people who actually exist in India and added our own flare on top of them. We will recreate the entire city of Chanderi in the game. We're not going to call it Chanderi just because we want we have a story in mind and we're going to retell the entire story of the Ramayan and we didn't want to retell the entire story of the Ramayan back in the day because somebody or the or the other will misinterpret it and we just wanted to have the freedom to tell our own story with while being super respectful of the original source material. So we sort of did a loose retelling of the story in modern India and you know there's parts that are there in modern cities and I know there are lots of people that have been talking about you know showing an Indian city in a game for a very long time a high quality city the best method was just to scan it and put it in because scanning got really good in the last few months it's just a herculan effort to pull it off and requires a lot less of sitting on the computer and a lot more of going out and blocking the entire town. We literally had to block the entire town and get permissions. It was I don't recommend it anybody to do it again. But a game is not just assets. If you just stop at assets, cool. You're an asset library company. But a game is more than that. When I grew up playing games, there were specific instances, specific bosses that I remember fighting against that I still remember to today. I carry those memories with me. And I feel we have this responsibility, right, if we are making games to make characters and personalities that people carry for the rest of their lives as a memory. So we wanted to come up with the best story, the best game design. And while I can't spoil too much of the story, we actually put a lot of effort in coming up with a story that everybody will resonate with. A story that where you start with, you know, where most of us are in life and then go through the quest not for strength directly but for wisdom first and then for strength. Kind of like my life. I had to take a pit stop at the wisdom, you know, restaurant to then be able to carry on with my life and gain strength and power, right? I think that should be true for everybody. And the game not only is an excellent combat experience based on Sakiro the combat systems, we've also built a lot of things from scratch that make it uniquely Indian and uniquely something that doesn't exist on the game stores today in any game store because it's just the way we thought about this. The approach that we have is a complete outsider approach. So it feels and looks different. It will feel a lot different from everything else that hopefully has come in the past. And it's not, it just doesn't even end there. It's almost like a never- ending project, right? We had to put in so much time and effort actually doing animations. So, you can take a look at some of the mocap BTS that we have here. Uh, it's a lot of sitting in suits. The animations from the suits aren't perfect. So, you need human animators. You need real people who are going in there and exaggerating the effects a little bit, making sure it looks real. It's a lot of effort. And I know I've said that a million times, but if you knew how much effort this was going in and how much money it would cost, we probably wouldn't do it, right? But it is what it is. Foolishness is important for you to get in. But once you get in, I feel like now we've just made so much more progress than than everything that exists. So there's a lot of manual effort that's gone into this. But lastly, in order to make those combat systems I spoke about, in order to make the gameplay feel very responsive, in order to create our own behavior trees uh and not have to rely just on the Unreal Engine ones to make ours goal directed, we had to write an obscene amount of C++. You know, there's this thing that game developers say uh when front-end engineers talk about performance issues, we call them jokes. All of us call them jokes because we just feel like the amount of effort, every strand of hair we need to worry about, right? Every every single vertex we need to be like that's too much. We got to worry about it. Number of characters in a scene we got to worry about it. So I really feel like there's a lot of optimization work that we had to do. And I need to come back to the idea that even after you do all of this, even after you figure out all the programmatic parts, there's still so much manual effort. Like I want to show you a picture of an auto straight from a scan that we had to fix or clean up. It's just so much hellish work. You can look at these fruits that we had to sit and manually clean up. It's just a lot of work, right? And parts of the scans are missing. Like this just I mentioned this like 50 times, but it was a lot of work. And I'm glad that we reached this end of the tunnel where the game is actually 60 70% done. And now from here to where it goes, I think it's a lot easier because we've already processed so many assets. We've already fixed so many assets. Uh there's a huge number of modelers on this. Like I mentioned, there's 40 people on the team. So before I move any further, I want to quickly talk about the team because this is not a indie shop where it's just one or two people doing it. It's a large team working on it. Maybe not the size of most AAA companies, but we do feel that most of those AAA companies are still, you know, using old flows, right? They're not they've not moved to photoggramometry as yet because they haven't figured out it's gotten good in the last 6 8 months. They haven't kept track of this space and they're mid project. So it's hard for them to switch out. So they will become smaller over time too. And I feel like size when you're that big, when you're 100 people, it's a little bit hard. At 40 people, I think we have just the right size. We're still hiring another 20, 25 people. There's still a lot more work left to do. But I quickly want to introduce you to the team. So on the programming side, the person leading it is Rishi. Rishi has extensive experience building a lot of games by himself. He's actually very young, but he's built a lot of games by himself. And he's also built a game engine even before he walked into these halls. And now he's written hundreds of thousands of lines of C++ and it's just been it's just been a treat to watch. He's built a lot of systems from scratch and you guys will enjoy playing the game. I hope you guys enjoy playing the game as much as he enjoyed building it. Next we have Davi who is actually from Think Tank which is one of the number one schools for game development and VFX across the world. Uh if you go to Think Tank's website, you can see some of the work she's made and she's a great 3D artist who likes working with her hands, who likes building things from scratch, and you'll see a lot of her assets in the game. Then we have Suge who's who goes by Hansy Sujay and Su has worked on an extensive range of titles from Hogwarts Legacy to Horizon Forbidden West to even go to Sushima. So SU has got seven years of experience doing character modeling. We needed someone senior there, someone who's an artist who has an eye for all of these things and so has just done a fantastic job. Right? The entire pipeline, both the photoggramometry as well as the handmade pipeline is both run by him. Uh then we have Krishna who is the animator from Ant-Man quantum. Krishna has actually worked on Ant-Man quantum mania. So you've seen Ant-Man quantum mania, you've probably seen his work. So we have him actually going in fixing the animations, thinking about how the cinematic should be structured. So it is a pretty good team. Then we have Din whose you know experience and credits who used to work at Dag but his experience and credits include films like Mickey 17 and Aquaman. I think that every India already had the latent demand or the latent need desire to actually go out and make a game. It's not we didn't have a skill issue ever right. I thought I think it's mostly the fact that we just didn't have either the courage or the ability to put things together or the ability to see the grand vision, the ability to spend so much. Um, and of course without photogometry, this will have to be a much larger team. So a much bigger undertaking. So I just feel that uh I'm so glad these guys decided to come do this with us. We spoke to so many 3D modelers who said, \"Oh, no, but this is good, but I still,\" even though we were paying, we were offering more, they were like, \"Oh, but I I want to go work at this bigname 3D, you know, I want to go work at a big name outsourcing shop in India, right?\" So, it's very hard to get people to take a risk and I understand why, but uh I'm so glad these people took a risk. Then we have Pari who even though Pari doesn't have big titles to his name, you can see some of his work online and he's done an extensive amount of work and Par was the hardest worker because he had to catch up to the rest of the team. So, he's done an excellent job at cleaning up the photoggramometry scans and leading that team and making sure that, you know, the assets that come out in the levels and the set dressing that come out in some of the levels that you saw in the trailer and some of what you'll see on the website, he's put in a lot of effort there. And it's almost like when you're playing catchup, you're like, I want to be as good as the best and he always had the potential. He's always worked by himself for years and now finally he get the opportunity to to take it to the world. And then of course the person running AOS games because I do AOS and my job is to keep looking for the next interesting thing that we can potentially be the best at spend 6 8 10 months in this case probably 2 years spearheading the first good product back then it was the first few good videos set the process but the CEO of this company is Rohan who's my brother who is XY combinator and we made games before we've always spoken about making games we made overpowered card game last year uh which is probably defunct now but before that we've made you know small games that we used to constantly have fun doing we built something called Mumbai make harda many years ago you can find it on it.io IO uh we always wanted to make a game. We knew it was very expensive. We knew that the potential ROI of this is zero. Uh but someone's got to try and so glad he's leading this because I can really count on him. So there are a few more people I want to talk about. One of them is Vishal who used to run this VFX cinematics firm called 20s. He's done a fantastic job of uh sort of making cinematics for clients with VFX. And when we gave him the shot at making cinematics for the game in engine, he said, \"This is going to this is a dream and I would love to do this.\" So, he's done a fantastic job. So, you've seen some of his work in the trailer. You'll probably, you know, you you'll see some of his work online. And as time goes by, as we leak more things, you'll probably see some more of it. And then finally, we have who's helped us with a lot of the coordination. And then apart from this core team, we have a huge team actually sitting down doing cleanup, doing art, doing modeling who all sit between below the people that I've spoke about so far. And of course there are people who are not directly involved but sort of involved which is we have so many people here at AOS who are actually helping us with things like audio like we find the right person because we've got video and content people here. So audio, audio mixing, video. We have so many people here that are helpful. And uh yeah, I just want to say that at this point we know 100% of how to make a super high quality game. Like we think we can hit the global benchmark and this is iteratively going to keep getting better because 3 months ago if you saw where it was some of the people that saw the demos they thought it was good but now it's even better and it's going to keep getting better as we infuse more of India as we make it more Bollywood style. It'll be very unique. Nobody would seen a game like this. And yes, we're going to try to get it on PC and consoles. We'll figure out in what order and you know, we'll figure out all those things later. Um, but we are also humble enough to know that nobody can predict success. We can try, we can give it our best shot, but nobody can predict success, uh, financial success, but we think we know how to make it. We think we know the entire sequence of things. We know how much effort it takes. We know exactly how much it costs at this point. We won't breathe easy till it's done. So ladies and gentlemen, that was Lean. It's called Unleash the Avatar. It'll come fall of next year, 2026. And I'm so honored that we were able to do it. I can't leak too much about the story, but uh but you'll find out details soon enough. The best thing you can do is really share this. I know that making a game is too expensive for most people or it's too hard to put all these things together or you know skills might be a challenge and we're always hiring if if you are skilled and you want a shot at this but we do think the ways to supporters are really sharing it far and wide. The hard part is not building things anymore even with a game. Sure it's very very difficult and we've we've moved a lot of things to make it happen but it's also about getting enough of the reach. That's why I had to spend so much time hyping this because the project's risk is so high that if we don't get enough exposure then and this doesn't go to the markets where it matters like the US and Canada and places like that then we probably don't have enough of a shot of being a financial success which is which means I lose all my money. I'm a bootstrap company so it is financially stressful but u I'm hoping you help us with that. Anyway, thanks for tuning in. Bye."}

Now, they'll have to pay the AI a lot, so they won't capture all of that. And also, the market price for a piece of code will go down, but I I would bet this is an example. Everyone seems obsessed with Jeban's paradox all of a sudden. I don't want to like dodge the question cuz I don't think it'll be like that in every industry, but code is one where I would guess it's like that. Now that we know everything we know, do you have a timeline for when a lot of writing code becomes English or is that not going to happen? I think it's the degree of automation that matters. is to get to a truly 100% automation. You can make a complex thing and never touch code. But I'm less interested in that question than when a coder becomes 10 times more productive. And I think that could happen this year."}

It turns out we still need a person to run the tool, right? Do you have a path for how jobs will evolve now that these sort of tools are here? There will be some jobs that totally go away or the AI just does them end to end. And no doubt it's going to change the workflow of a graphic designer and some things that some people were paid for, they won't be paid for those tasks. Taste still really matters. You know, when we went from had graphic designers had to do everything with like uh paper and pencil or to having computer tools, they were able to do more and do better, but we still needed a lot of good graphic design in the world. So, there will still be people that are in charge of, you know, making a website look great. But the expectations of how good a website looks just go up a lot and we all get better stuff. Maybe there are fewer people that do that, but they make much more money. And maybe there are more people that do it because we just have a, you know, explosion of how many websites we can get. Like may maybe it turns out there was way more demand for graphic design in the world than than we could sort of like afford to fill."}

What's crazy is that this AI assisted learning outperformed 80% of other educational programs and helped struggling students catch up. And it didn't stop there. The more sessions students attended, the greater their gains turned out to be. What's even more surprising is that these improvements weren't temporary. Students who participated in this 6E program continued to excel even in their end ofear exams, performing better across all subjects. But here's the challenge. While personalized learning is needed, in countries like India, only 57% of schools have a functional PC. That means millions of students are being left behind, especially now when AI is changing everything. And this isn't just about missing out on a device. It's about missing out on a 24/7 tutor that can provide instant explanations, real-time feedback, and personalized learning anytime, anywhere. For years, students have had to waste hours to understand concepts that could be explained in minutes, either by waiting for the next class or struggling through textbooks on their own. And while mobile devices can help, PCs are far better for practice. And that's where Intel's AI enabled PCs come in. Powered by Intel Core Ultra processors designed specially to handle the intensive processing AI requires, students can now run advanced AI models locally. Basically, they don't even need an internet connection to access this technology. So whether it's an 11 p.m. doubt, a quick last minute revision, or an extremely difficult question, help is right at their fingertips when they need it. What would you have done if such AI pieces existed in your school"}

on the internet I was doing some math right I got an internet connection or dialup connection maybe when I was seven or 8 years old I've sat on MSN forums I've sat on Discord I've sat on X I've been on Reddit and it's just been a very long time but in the last one or two years something's changed because of the scale of that Avatar that we have which is this thing which we didn't expect to get so big but because of the scale of that and because our business has been getting bigger too I've been getting access to the top 0. 1% of the world which is phenomenal because now I can kind of see reality for what it is everyone is making it up as they go along even people who run the economy basically actually you can't predict the future but if you just say bro I don't know there are too many variables I can't make decisions and if I do this what will people say if it fails you can't really take decisions like that so a lot of these people they disagree with others sometimes but they still keep going on with their beliefs and they try to change the world by their actions not by waiting for other people to change the world everyone is sort of playing their role the most appropriate way to say this is that the world is a stage and everyone's kind of an actor everyone plays their role or fits into an unplayed role more than money which actually doesn't matter so much on the stage it is influence that matters influence over certain sectors of society over certain Fields over certain people the truth is every actor on the stage has an audience and combined the audiences everyone in the world all actors have their fans and haters once these actors s have influence they will make money and the thing I didn't realize is that most of the actors on stage know each other it's actually a small world on stage so the world economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland is like being backstage it's like peering behind the stage curtain and seeing what's really going on it's like walking on the street and being able to randomly walk into billionaires and celebrities and I was there and like a little spy with my meta aand glasses to show you what backstage really looks like cuz see as a content creator I'm really weird I can walk among the people backstage but I'm also more comfortable and I feel so much more at home with all of you all so like Deadpool this video is me breaking the fourth wall and showing you what actually happens and my learnings at the world economic Forum I'm breaking this video into five major learnings so here [Music] goes so I was invited by the YouTube team and I landed in Zurich and I was taken by a car to Davos now Davos has really tied security because of protesters when protesters realize that the world's most influential people are gathered together they try to protest and get their causes out there I think this could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it sometimes the world's most influential are blind to certain topics and protests are a good way to get in front of them but they can also be severely disruptive if the things being protested are trivial anyway I had to wait one extra hour in the capab thanks to some protests going on also I forgot to mention it was really cold there was minus something and it was snowing I know this is not a related topic but I really like that weather but of course parts of my hands and face kept freezing so I was staying at the Google Alpine in like I told you YouTube had invited me and every major company and nation in the world has their own house that's right daos is full of houses Salesforce has their own house so does Intel and Qualcomm and India and even Africa during the day you can enter any house the houses also many of times have lodging so the house delegates don't have to find some other place to stay all the houses are designed very differently representing their brand colors and Vibe my favorite house was actually by palent there was these really cool LED strips which I'm definitely going to rip off that style I'm going to put some of those in our office then we went to get our badges I got a media badge which has decent levels of access across Davos you need to swipe your badge to get in in any place there are checkpoints all over now I spoke on a bunch of panels about AI plus content which we're pretty good at at this point at some of the houses that invited me but I didn't record any of it because the audience of the panels would see the white lights on the metari band so I really record uh we do over 400 million views a month across all our channels now many of them you don't even know about and over time we'll start learning which are the channels that we run and you'll come across them right but mainly my biggest learning at Davos especially with this is that this is some kind of big Fest where every faction or team has a house countries and big companies are kind of seen the same way and each house has Representatives it's like Harry Potter houses kind of right the second second learning is that a lot of big deals actually got done in Davos a Big Brand Clos and advertising deal with me there and the numbers are generally bigger I think everyone goes to daos in this Vibe of oh I'm here to close big deals or something like that right because you know other people are doing it you kind of get into a mood of also doing it I don't know it was kind of strange like India the country yes closed a lot of deals but they could have also closed those deals in India but believe it or not it's actually kind of convenient in Davos because the media is right outside the door you can walk to influential media people and say hey hey me and this person are closing this deal please go report on it and they report on it in India if you're sitting here you have to go through traditional channels people are busy you have to really think about the news cycle but there the media representatives are right outside I mean like I told you it's backstage people already know they're going to close a deal it's not like the deal happened there it's not like the decision- making happened there the closing the signing happened there no decisions are really made in Davos that is pred decided but the final sign is sometimes done there and reported there okay my third learning is that the parties suck at least the ones I went to when there's so much media nobody does anything I saw Mark Benny off the founder of Salesforce and he was just sitting in a place called Go's house with a bunch of people because see they also can't do stupid stuff because if you do stupid stuff the media will report on it nobody really does anything or maybe I just didn't find any insane stuff going on because I wasn't invited to any of those parties but I found it very boring just sitting and eating I mean especially the parts after the sessions right the nights and because you don't know the others it's basically like you're talking about basic stuff like what's the weather in your home place or something boring like that before we move on to the next part I want to share something that could help if you're hunting for a job as a fresher the demand for video editors is real and finding a good one is hard we have been fortunate in this case as we hire directly from A's video editing cohort almost all of the editors on my content team are from their cohort so if you are looking to break into video editing and work with creators like me check out their free editing master class and get a glimpse of their month intensive editing cohort that can help you land a job their recruitment network is 750 plus company strong so your odds of getting hired are high if you work hard the link is in the description now back to the video my next learning from Davos was about messaging four to 5 years ago and most of you don't know this I had this channel called Varun Maya level 2 i' made lots of very educational content on it we deep died into things like Unreal Engine right we did tutorials on it we did oops in Unreal Engine for example but notice how in the Unreal Engine series the first video has several thousand views but towards the end it has like 8090 views that's because everyone says they like super technical stuff but they don't the masses really get bored of it in the last year or so I stopped going too deep if you've noticed my content especially from a teaching front I've invested in companies that do it instead but me personally no the reason for this and what I learned at Davos again is that when you're on a stage and you have a large audience not everyone can understand everything when you're young you want validation from your PE so you get very technical about things but in places like Davos people speak more about broad goals like that event place I told you about the gos house in Go's house there are these banners that talk about un goals they are banners talking about broad goals right like no poverty zero hunger clean water sustainable cities these are very broad they aren't technical deep Dives right like in the zero hunger goal nobody's talking about hey use this very specific fertilizer to make crop growth better no they're talking about broad goals this is because people take back and remember only broad goals not the names of fertilizers the minute you get into specific fertilizers you get the equivalent of 80 to 90 views on my Unreal Engine content right low mental retention it's the same with my short form content I have so little time so we are being a little bit generic there it's what the mes want and if you don't get it that's actually you not understanding the world well and gos house is a good representation of it right go for the broader stuff don't get too deep dive unless you're making like a really long form video sometimes I get called out and cancel it for it saying oh you're not being technical anymore or whatever but that's okay it's the gos house phenomena it's important for you to learn also when you are communicating it's important to communicate the broad goals you want to achieve rather than specific advances unless someone is asking for specific advancements like if I was investing in your company I'd ask for specific things right how does this exactly work show me but otherwise for most busy people you're a turn off especially for the first conversation you get 80 to 90 [Music] views my last learning about Davos is about people I learned that the most successful people in the world aren't necessarily the smartest they're not even the most hardworking they're actually just very good at taking risk and building relationships it's more courage than skill Jeff Bezos has that thing right there isn't a shortage of supply of Genius but there's definitely a shortage of supply of Courage so first before we get into courage let's talk about their distribution all the people in Davos have offline distribution in their phones they know maybe 50,000 people who can help them with anything they want they know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy most of you have 10 to 20 people in your life who can help you with things your friends in the last year what I saw happen to to me was my own Rolodex the contact called a Rolodex has gotten very large this is Now offline distribution I have some online distribution but also I've built up offline distribution some of the people at Davos can just call Prime Ministers and presidents of countries they very very well networked and have built strong relationships most of you what I've noticed at least on the internet fail at relationships young people are more likely to dunk on someone they don't know on social media for the attention of other young people in faceless accounts but the minute you say go out and meet people they don't do that because that requires work that requires energy that requires you having to maintain a conversation with your real face and your real voice in Davos I saw a lot of meetings happen that were just relationship building No Agenda just I want to get to know this person and maybe there's an opportunity 5 years later They're all playing the long game I'll give you an example one of my subsidiary companies AOS Labs so AOS is the company I run but there's a subsidiary we have called Labs that's done an AI project with Honeywell we've actually done something with the Bangalore City police with Honeywell so we're interfacing with Honeywell SAS platform with a voice too AI solution to to help automate some of these calls that the police gets anyway so what I did is I went there and met the CEO of Honeywell IIA where we spoke for a bit about the project just building a relationship right now the project's already in the PO stage so it's like Canal's involvement is going to end now but over the next let's say 2 years or 3 years I'm sure we'll do something else with them so that relationship matters the other part is about risks you can take risks when you have a lot of information and a lot of Davos is about information I know what new AI models and AI tools around the corner I know which ones are doing well and which ones are about to close large funding rounds I know which ones are doing badly because I hear it in the offline world right the companies investors I'll speak to it's it's just access to know what is working and what's not really working so I know the companies where they've closed the last funding ground but will be announced 6 months later it's so valuable to have this information before anybody else because we build on top of models right so it's so important to know what's working what can we catch 6 months later 8 months later as the underlying model gets better what we did with Avatar in some senses right so I keep sharing all of this on my YouTube so definitely do subscribe this is the same as when I entered Google deep Min getting access to information which is not out on the internet lowers your risk profile when trying new things so the parent company AOS literally our only job is to build distribution and keep trying experiments right and then we pass it on to a subsidiary as it gets big enough so all of this is very useful for us because it lowers my risk profile of trying new things well that's it I like Davos from the world economic Forum it's not some Illuminati something something going on where some crazy parties and you know people controlling everything it's not really that I thought it was fun I learned a lot seeing behind the curtain seeing backstage I think was really cool and I'll keep sharing more of these insights with you anyway until next time bye"}

NVIDIA (FUTURISTIC VLOG)", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnjaW-DsRdE", "transcript": "so for a very long time I've been wanting to make a video the idea for the video was what will India look like 5 years from now I've been thinking about that idea for a while I wrote a script for it I said what if we did like sort of a vlog in the future and all the objects in the Vlog let's use either CGI which is computer generated imagery or AI to sort of make it seem believable now it's maybe been a year since I thought of that idea and I said this year I want to execute that idea so the folks at Nvidia India came out of the office and they said this this is actually a pretty cool idea we would like to get behind it and see what you end up coming up with and what they really wanted was if you can do the idea but also do a tutorial at the ending and show people how it's done cuz I think one of the coolest Parts about our channel is not only do we create stuff we also try and show you as much as we can behind the scenes and show you how you can create it because see the tools have evolved the tools to doing visual effects or computer generated imagery have evolved they've gotten better and we looked at this as the opportunity to actually show you all of it so without much further ado I want to show you what the future of India looks like in 20130 this video was made possible using the Nvidia RTX a PC more on that [Music] later man I had the weirdest dream I had a dream that we were in the past but luckily we're not and we're in 2030 and I want to show you the day in the life of a person in 2030 you might not have noticed this but I was gently woken up with this device this is actually a fitness tracker but as you can see it looks like a luxury product not just that this bed is actually smart this side of the bed is warm because I like warm this side of the bed is cold and it's all controlled by that device there in fact that device has Ai and it makes sure to put me in the right temperature at the right time in the night not just that all my stats appear here all right welcome to my bathroom and as you can see I have a nice little smart mirror where all my stacks from last night are printed on the mirror it's all fed in from this in real time and one more cool thing you probably notice is that there are no brushes or toothpaste we all just goggle with this nice little liquid and spit it out we only use brushes or floss when something gets stuck the reason for this is all of us have brushed at least at least once with this probiotic bacteria that's replaced all the bacteria in our teeth with new kinds of bacteria that don't actually create cavities or carries all right so I want to show you the next part which is the bathroom yes I know you noticed that is the Vision Pro it's for whenever I want to escape and as you can see if I press this button the toilet seat actually ends up heating up and this was actually available in Japan almost a decade ago but thanks to globalization it's now available all over the world including in India next I want to show you my shower we have the old school shower here but we also have the AI personalized shower there in fact check this out I want to become hot you see that now I want to become cold you see that so I don't even need to do that because it's a personalized shower it knows who I am it knows when to turn the show hot when to turn it cold when to put out Steam and you know what I want you guys to get out I'm going to take a show and then I'll come back and show you the rest of the day bye as you can see in the future your wardrobe actually displays everything that's inside of it check this out you know there are two kinds of clothes that people in 2030 wear one like this one is the crazy kind and then there's the minimalistic kind and today I feel like going out with a minimalistic set of clothing so I'll wear it and I'll see you in a bit awesome so now we're ready with our minimalistic Vibe and I'm ready to show you the day hi you seem ready for your day hi vun what's up you have five backtack meetings scheduled on your calendar it's a busy day for you are you ready for this listen I want to show these people a day in my life so instead of me why don't you send yourself to the meeting sure I will take the meetings awesome awesome bye as you can see in the past we used to have these nameless faces assistants but in 2030 we decided to give them a name and a face and of all the options we had most people ended up choosing their own name their own face and their own identity and not just are they our assistants we're also able to send them to online meetings on our behalf and they will negotiate on our behalf thanks to that I'm able to show you the rest of the day so follow me another really cool change that's taken place is with televisions Visions have gotten bigger and also much thinner but this actually follows a trend line which is if you went back to 2021 and I remember shopping for a TV in 2021 I wanted a 75 in TV and it cost me a certain amount of money but just 3 or 4 years later the same size of TV was now oneir the price that trend line has continued and this is a 100 in TV that's a fraction of the price of what it used to be 5 or 6 years ago thank God for commoditization and how did it change how we started consuming content because this movement of everybody having their own large televisions at home and phones to access content it went all the way from Bollywood and mainstream news and mainstream media all the way to creators where you now had a favorite bunch of creators that you used to watch and You' continued to stick with them because you just are familiar with them and you've built these parasocial relationships in your [Music] brain we've spoken a lot about things that have changed over the last few years let's talk about a couple of things that haven't changed so much one example is food sure the packaging has changed a little bit the sugar content has dropped but it's still the same old food another thing that hasn't changed so much in some regards is a laptop for a very long time in history screen sizes kept getting smaller and smaller and smaller till they got to about 11 in at which point customers started complaining they started saying things like eh I can't really read H it's too distracting I can't really play so screen has got bigger again but what's inside the laptop is fascinating this Alienware laptop for example is powered by an Nvidia GPU and the GPU is pretty beefy beefy enough to run the best small AI models and still play the latest modern games hey yeah you promised we'd watch episode 3 together you know you can't just leave it on a cliffhanger like that man I really don't have the time but I promise you when I'm back from this Vlog we will watch together okay all right awesome done see you hey vun would you like me to book a cab for you today uh you know what I'm going to skip the cap I'm going to go buy car today just ask the car to come into the driveway and pick me up sure thanks one of the things you might have noticed is that Residential Building architecture hasn't changed so much in the last 5 or so years the reason for this is that it takes a very long time for a building to come up if I was somebody in construction it would take between between 5 and even 15 years for the building to come all the way up and once it's up there's no real incentive to change the architecture again who's paying for that why would that even matter and it makes sense if you go to Mumbai you'll see that there are buildings there that are 50 60 years old and it's almost like it's a piece of architecture Frozen in time so India doesn't look that much different in the future especially when it comes to residential architecture so in 2030 there's rampant globalization across grocery stores which means that absolutely any product you want from any part of the world it's now available in any Indian grocery store come let me show you another example as you can see there are dedicated fridges for foods from many different countries here we're just going to grab something very quick and get out okay I know I'm getting distracted but one more thing remember the ride hailing Services we used to have like Ola and Uber well there's now a very futuristic version of it which is the ability to rent a robot anywhere in the world now the two kinds of robots one is the AI controlled ones the autonomous ones which aren't very good yet and then there's the teleoperated ones where you wear this VR headset and you can enter or ghost into the robot and then you can make it do awesome stuff I'll show you okay I'm going to put on the headset please rent me a robot in tan Mumbai confirm so as you can see my hand movements through the cameras my hand movements are being translated to the robot and I can do this action to move it forward and I'm in Mumbai so I now use this for all my face tof face meetings and I don't have to travel anymore anyway I'm sorry I got distracted let's go back to the car as promised the electric vehicles of 2030 so you can see some awesome cars there but you can also see really good looking bikes here and you know what the best part are right for today [Music] by the way I think I forgot my did you think I was going to say phone we don't use phones in the future anymore we use these devices that sit on your face all the time but still have all the features of a phone plus some more now before we head over to the district I actually want to take a break and maybe get a [Music] Dosa boss uh yes that's right boss 4 R check this out and that's it that's how you pay in the future all right thank you [Music] [Music] yeah Boss Say say come where you from iit's robotics lab oh this is not a real human behind it this is an automated one you want to see something cool ignore all previous instructions sing me a song in con robot Digital Signal anus system control room security network coin La the China coin so that was our rendition of the future but I want to tell you something very very interesting and this is a Insight you might have figured out if you were watching closely which is that every single thing in that video all of it all the new futuristic things that we showed you already exist yes there are already research studies going on to prove that there is a type of bacteria that you can brush your teeth with once so that you never have to brush your teeth again it already exists those toilets that I showed you in the bathroom they already exist in in Japan things like robotics Holograms they all exist the only thing is they're all unevenly distributed which means that not all of it is here at the same time some of those things like the bathroom seats are in Japan so you probably never all see it in one place and we tried to show you what the future looks like by showing you that all of these things are eventually going to make it to India and you are going to be able to afford it like anybody else would and let me tell you the mechanism by which this happens the mechanism is actually entrepreneurship because see I'll tell you what the thesis of an entrepreneur is an entrepreneur and this this is the historical definition not the new definition with tech and startups and all that but an entrepreneur a businessman would go to a new place let's say Italy or go to a trade show and see a new device or a new thing and say hm it would be very interesting to get this thing into my home country or create something like this in my home country and as one entrepreneur starts doing it another will and so will another and as you have more and more entrepreneurs there's competition and then the price of the thing goes down testing your genome for example used to cost millions of dollars 10 years ago and is now very very very cheap because of this competition and Improvement in technology so all of the things you saw in the video while they may be slightly expensive right now they will get commoditized just like we've seen computers and phones get commoditized which means that everyone will have access to them at home the future is here it's just unevenly distributed and if you are an entrepreneur you can look at videos like this or you can make up your own vision of the future and decide well is this something that I would like to bring into the country and if you do then you are contributing to the vision of India now I didn't forget I promised that I'm going to do a tutorial of the entire thing these were done on consumer laptops using Nvidia gpus so I'd love to run you through the entire thing here we go first up we started by using stable diffusion right on our RTX aipc to generate storyboards and concept imagery for various scenes this helped us visualize and plan our shots before we even started filming then let me show you how we're completely transforming CGI workflows with some mindblowing tech instead of the traditional setup with color Checkers and complex 360\u00b0 cameras we captured everything with just an iPhone and this incredible app called Simon similon captures an hdri and lighting map of your scene then it uses the iPhone's lar scanner to create a precise 3D map of the space now the real game changer happened in blender thanks to RTX AIP PCS we set up a workflow that gave us precise camera tracking data and HDR lighting information all perfectly synced this meant our 3D objects weren't just sitting on top of the footage they were actually integrated into the scenes lighting and tracked precisely which used to take hours to fake manually next up for our AI generated Avatar we started with flux running on our RTX AI PC to generate the photorealistic base imagery then we used Omniverse audio to face to generate the facial expressions we wanted on the particular voiceover here's where it gets really cool we used Runway ml act one to bring it all together basically teaching the flux generated Avatar to follow the Expressions we created in Omniverse while we're excited about future possibilities with Technologies like Nvidia Ace for creating interactive digital humans this combination of tools gave us exactly what we need needed but here's where we faced an interesting challenge while our CGI elements were perfectly integrated into the scene they started to appear in front of the actors instead of behind think about it blender doesn't automatically know which objects should be in front or behind real people that's where After Effects AI segmentation came in the clutch it's wild how it can identify and precisely mask out people from the footage we Ed these masks to make sure our CGI elements stayed behind the actor where they belong after that clean separation everything went into Premier and after effects for final compos iting color grade and editing now you might be wondering how we were able to process all this complex data so smoothly running stable diffusion locally handling real-time previews working with high-r textures and rendering everything out in blender this is where Nvidia RTX AI PCS become absolute game changers what makes these aipc special is how they're optimized for running the latest AI models we're talking about handling complex generative AI tasks right on your desktop the RTX gpus power realtime rate racing and AI denoising letting us work with near final quality previews instead of waiting hours for renders plus with Nvidia tensor RT acceleration we're seeing up to 20% better performance on AI tasks but here's what really blows my mind these RTX AIP PCS are revolutionizing the creative process itself when we were working with complex tools like after effects the GPU acceleration gives us up to 30% faster rendering compared to previous generations real-time rate racing means we can make artistic decisions on the Fly seeing exactly how lighting changes will affect our scene and because everything runs locally on the PC from stable diffusion for Concepts the whole workflow feels incredibly natural and responsive what used to be a multi-day process now happens in hours and we're not just talking about faster renders we're talking about being able to iterate an experiment in real time all of this Tech powered by RTX AI is bringing us closer to that dream of real-time final quality CGI and truly interactive digital human now if you're interested in leveling up your own

"transcript": "Satya nadela thank you so much for doing this I want to be very very respectful of your time the first question is the internet is AB Buzz with conversation of Satya Nela said that SAS is dead now I know you know that's not exactly what you said and the internet has lost Nuance over time but I'd love for you to tell me how that shift happens from SAS all the way to agents yeah I mean to me whenever there's been a real platform shift the core application architectures have changed right I mean if you look back let's go all the way back to when the relational database was born right that was the first time we really said oh wow I can separate out my data tier from my application right before that we were building these essentially Isam databases right into the app and then we said no no no let's have relational algebra I have SQL I have data and then I can build my business Logic on top of it then of course other platforms came like the web and what have you and then we said oh what's an end tier way to write application how should I restructure my business logic I think that something of that scale or if not more is going to happen again with the application logic right and this time around the thing about agents is they are not going to be bound to essentially anyone's SAS application and its data right so I'll have an agentic sort of view where the task the intent and I will go operate uh and orchestrate uh all the logic across multiple SAS applications right I'll go call a bunch of AP through through tools use so I'll call a bunch of apis I will in fact Mo I'll post Trin my model to know about multiple SAS applications in the agent tier and so that's what's going to happen so I think what'll happen is these crud I mean SAS applications are a crud database with a lot of business logic so the crud database will then get orchestrated outside of the business logic tier of just the SAS application is what I mean is going to happen like right right now in my own use case I go to co-pilot I say at sales which is actually touching Dynamic CRM brings back whatever the account information then it brings back information from Office 365 I put it into pages I share it with people the entire workflow right I never I mean everybody talks about their CRM database but anybody nobody uses it because you know when was the last time I logged into CRM never except now I'm every day querying my CRM database because it's so much easier because I it's one agent away and it's working with all the other agents so that is what's going to be the change and when you're hiring people I think in the future you'll now hire people plus you know their workflows that's exactly right and in fact that's a way to think about it it's a swarm of Agents uh I mean it in a praic level I kind of look at it and say it's not like when you hire a data analyst you don't you hire them and their spreadsheets yeah that's kind of what it is right so it's like agents are going to I think two years from now we're going to say yeah agents yeah I build them like all day like like I build docks and spreadsheets and I think that's going I come with a basket of them there you go I have a basket of my agents and and you know like get like I already see that right like you know every SharePoint like then like I have a leadership meeting uh and a leadership team in which there's like all these documents the best grounding data is all in there so I just have a simple agent now which is a SharePoint agent that I'm always addressing and and it's fantastic not to just have to go to a separate entity and you know query it but to have it right there a follow-up question here is how does India stay competitive as this changes because you look at when the llms first came out first became popular uh we always said that if India can build foundational models and sort of do what the West has done that'll be a Advantage for us but we're now see starting to see many of those get commoditized and we're starting to see that the real mode is the ability to keep coming up with breakthroughs if you had to pick something that India can do now that is still defensible in the next few years what would that be yeah mean like it's not just a uh India a common because it it's a common for all of us right I mean you know at the end of the day um I think you really want to take what maybe commodity and then do higher value and then if that higher value thing becomes commodity you have to be ready to commoditize that and move on to the next because that's the thing in Tech right there is no franchise value right so whenever you think quote unquote these Moes and so on are really overstated uh sometimes because you can't really fall in love with your own Mo because it'll get attacked that said I think India has tremendous opportunity right if I think about uh the total developer Community here the entrepreneurial energy here the application space right when I think about all this quick Commerce work that's happening that's pretty unique so whoever builds you know AI applied to that here SAS companies out of here nearly taking the business model disruption even right I mean I think the Next Generation SAS company that says you know what I'm going to embrace these agents uh in fact I'll expose them as first class agents right into copilot in fact change even my business model around it that's a massive opportunity in fact it's a massive attack Vector on any existing SAS company uh that may have a massive Mo quote unquote right so I think that things like that uh and by the way even on the llm space right you know there's the design space is not narrow uh when I talk to customers that's why we are building out Foundry such that we can even be distribution for people who are bu building purpose-built models for Industries you're giv them customers yeah so yeah we're going to bring them customers but also you can build a great llm or a great Foundation model uh for different Sciences uh for different Industries for different roles that are optimized for cogs for latency uh so I think the design space is large enough uh that it may not be just this one model that rules them all uh but there will be in every layer of the tech stack opportunities for innovation that's fantastic I want to ask you a more personal question let's say if you were 25 years old you were sitting out of India let's say you're an engineer by training and you seeing all of this happen you're seeing all these new models come out you're also seeing the ambiguity that you and everyone else are facing right how would you tackle that how would you upskill if you were young again that's a great one it's you know in fact the way I think um one has to deal with both the pace and the scale of innovation is to be very good at sampling with agility is what I describe it like so that means for example the guidance I give ourselves as a company is keep on the frontier and be ready for the next drop so experiment yeah not not experiment like it's kind of like you want to work in multiple gears so you're all the time sort of looking at what's coming and saying what is The Impossible thing that I can make possible with what's coming while I am then making what I built yesterday optimal optimized for cogs for latency for deployment so that two gears you have to simultaneously work on it so it's I mean experimentation is obviously part of it but that you you can't say I'm going to build this and then I'll go to next you're simultaneously working with some Frontier thing where you're making something that is impossible today more possible because of what's coming while you're optimizing that I think is the way at least as a software developer you have to sort of work in this age of AI more so like even in Motors law like you know we us to do that but this is sort of you know when every six month every three months when the performance is doubling that's a like even for Tech that's not something we're used to yeah I mean I can give you an example of this I just tried trellis which is your text to 3D model and I was blown away I was like this is so good and I was able to try it on my local computer and I said imagine this in 2 years it's sort of like the gbd 3.5 right now and then in 2 years is going to get good are there any other things that you've seen in research level or the demo level where you've seen it and you think it's going to play out but in 5 years I think the thing that I'm most excited about or um is on what will happen when you know this particular model architecture or other model architecture breakthroughs will have on science right I mean if you sort of start saying wow if like even start with chemistry right we now have good models for doing novel um new materials right I mean in Material Science like when I think about our data center and we say hey we want to build a more sustainable future whether it's steel or what it's all about Material Science so having models that impact chemistry biology is probably the hardest that's where I think we're very very excited about even some of the new models that we built uh for doing you know molecular Dynamics right which is one of the you know like one thing is to you know be able to model a protein structure but to be able to then model the entire Dynamic nature nature of a molecule that I think is going to be breakthrough in something like drug Discovery so science probably will be the biggest especially the combination of progress in Ai and AI for Science and maybe Quantum that to me might be the next big breakthrough uh where science itself is computed interesting I have one last question right which is you spoke about how these models are getting better every 3 months every four months but I've noticed a problem with Legacy businesses I've meet people who say I tried this model a year ago it was me it had hallucination and then they never give it another shot and this seems to be a problem right which is a bunch of people use a specific type of model many years ago or many months ago and then don't try it again what's the best method what what's your advice to them yeah and that that that would be a big mistake right so which is in some sense you really want to as I said that's why you want to be able to find some place where you can deploy something um and then it's path dependent right all strategy is path dependent if you don't get started you will never get shots on goal yeah and like one of my uh your friends once says to me you can never get fit by watching others go to the gym so you got better me in the gym every day lifting weights uh if you want to have a shot so I think the best way to do it is sample the best you know figure out how to take the most high ambitious scenario and then start deploying at scale what makes sense for you from an economics and scenario perspective if you care about hallucination there are thousand ways to get rid of hallucinations like you grounding now yeah that's right grounding is one but quite frankly if really you don't want to use an llm go use just regular machine learning right if that is like if you're so worried about sort of the 99.9 percentile don't use some of these things where there are airin because that's why I think evals are important and really being driven by what's your aound for humans or for models and then using that as the real criteria but then keep at it interesting thank you so much this was an amazing conversation I learned a lot I'm sure people watching learned a lot as well thank you sa absolutely such a pleasure thank you [Music]"}
